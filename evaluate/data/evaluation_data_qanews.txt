Tutu and the Dalai Lama are recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\n\n\n\nTutu said he would pray for the defeat of South Africa's government, led by the African National Congress (ANC), which is rooted in the fight against the system of apartheid, or legal racial separation, that was present in South Africa until 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You are disgraceful,\" Tutu said about the government. \"You are behaving in a way that is totally at variance with the things for which we stood.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ANC plans to call on government officials to explain to South Africans why the visa process was delayed, spokesman Jackson Mtembu said.

A comparison to apartheid regimes, he said, was unfair.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not the first time the Dalai Lama has not been able to visit South Africa. In 2009, South Africa refused the Tibetan spiritual leader a visa to attend an international peace conference, saying it was not in the country's interest for him to attend.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn refusing the 2009 application, South Africa said that if the Dalai Lama attended the conference, the focus would shift away from the 2010 World Cup, the global soccer championship it was hosting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We cannot allow focus to shift to China and Tibet,\" presidential spokesman Thabo Masebe said, adding that South Africa had gained much from its trading relationship with China.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, and China pressures governments around the world to deny him any legitimacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeculation surfaced Tuesday that this year's visit was also affected by South Africa's relationship with China.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African Vice President Kgalema Motlanthe visited Beijing last week and met with Chinese President Hu Jintao to discuss bolstering bilateral ties.\n\n\n\n\n\nMotlanthe said South Africa was ready to boost the strategic partnership between the two countries to a new stage, according to the official Chinese news agency Xinhua.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Monyela said the application had nothing to do with China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are a sovereign nation which takes decisions in our domestic interest,\" Monyela said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama posted a message on Twitter last week that said: \"Even if the Chinese leave nothing but ashes, Tibet will rise from these ashes as a free country even if it takes a long time to do so.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Norgaard, CNN's Johannesburg bureau chief, contributed to this report.", "qa": [{"question": "who did say South Africa did not issue a visa on time?", "answers": ["Desmond Tutu", "his spokesman", "Archbishop Desmond Tutu"]}, {"question": "who is responsible for all this", "answers": ["government.", "nation failed to issue him a visa in time,", "his government"]}, {"question": "what is the African National Congress ?", "answers": ["fight against the system of apartheid, or legal racial separation, that was present in South Africa until 1994.", "which is rooted in the fight against the system of apartheid, or legal racial separation, that was present in South Africa until 1994.", "rooted", "which"]}, {"question": "Who does the African National Congress say should calm down?", "answers": ["Tutu"]}, {"question": "Who says the government is acting worse than apartheid regime?", "answers": ["Archbishop Desmond Tutu"]}, {"question": "Who was denied visa to South Africa in 2009?", "answers": ["Dalai Lama"]}]}

{"text": "(CNN) -- Pope John Paul II used to beat himself with a belt and sleep on a bare floor to bring himself closer to Christ, a book published Wednesday says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe late pope had a particular belt for self-flagellation and brought it with him to his summer residence, according to the book, \"Why he is a Saint: The True story of John Paul II.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As some members of his own entourage were able to hear with their own ears, both in Poland and in the Vatican, Karol Wojtyla flagellated himself,\" the book says, using the name the pope was given at birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the closet, among the cloaks, a particular pant-belt hung from a hook, which he utilized as a whip and one which he always had brought to Castel Gandolfo,\" the book says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe book was written by a Vatican insider, Slawomir Oder, with Italian journalist Saverio Gaeta of the Catholic weekly Christian Family. Oder is head of the Vatican committee investigating whether John Paul II should be declared a saint. John Paul died in 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe evil albino monk in Dan Brown's \"The Da Vinci Code\" may be the best-known example of self-flagellation these days, but the practice is not unusual in Catholicism -- or nearly as extreme as it is shown in the movie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When members or former members [of Opus Dei] see the monk go at it in the movie, they just burst out laughing, it's so nutty,\" said the Rev.

If it caused any harm, the Church would not allow it,\" he wrote on Opus Dei's Web site when the movie came out in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This voluntarily accepted discomfort is a way of joining oneself to Jesus Christ and the sufferings he voluntarily accepted in order to redeem us from sin.

{"text": "(CNN) -- A phone hacking scandal may have cost Rupert Murdoch his biggest-selling newspaper in 2011, but the billionaire media mogul managed to end the year with a modest addition to his empire -- an account on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin 48 hours of debuting with tweets about family, work and politics, Murdoch had pulled in more than 45,000 followers and stirred internet debate over why the 80-year-old was now embracing a technology often used to attack him.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tweets also raised doubts that the notorious technophobe was writing the messages himself. Twitter creator Jack Dorsey -- one of only four people being followed by Murdoch -- however insisted that the media mogul was writing \"with his own voice, in his own way.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMurdoch appears to have made his Twitter debut on New Year's Eve with a couple of brief comments on books including the biography of late Apple boss Steve Jobs, which he called \"interesting but unfair.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese were followed by praise for cinema releases \"We Bought a Zoo,\" and \"The Descendants,\" both produced by Murdoch's Fox Movies. These fueled suspicions that Murdoch's Twitter account was being used as a publicity tool to help improve his image after a damaging year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Could be brilliant News Corp PR operation,\" Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff tweeted after earlier commenting: \"Might be somebody who knows Murdoch, but it's not Rupert (he doesn't use a computer unassisted nor get his own email).\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers claimed that the voice of the tweets, as well as their faltering grammar and punctuation, were unmistakably Murdoch. \"You can tell by the tweets he's doing it himself,\" wrote CNN's Piers Morgan, a former editor of one of Murdoch's newspapers.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Murdoch's News Corp. confirmed to CNN the account is genuine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe account could offer new insight into a businessman whose life has been under intense scrutiny this year after revelations that journalists at News of the World, one of his most profitable newspapers, illegally accessed the voicemail messages of scores of celebrities and public figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter played a prominent role at the height of the scandal when it was used to pressure advertisers into boycotting the paper. Commentators said the loss of revenue was a key factor in Murdoch's decision to shut the paper down.\n\n\n\n\n\nMurdoch's subsequent appearance before a British parliamentary inquiry into phone hacking also caused a sensation on Twitter, particularly after his wife, Wendi Deng, pounced on a man who tried to attack him with a foam pie.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were echoes of Murdoch's parliamentary appearance -- which he called the \"most humble day day of my life\" -- in New Year pledges which he tweeted in a January 1 message to Dorsey. \"My resolutions, try to maintain humility and always curiosity. And of course diet!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there were also signs that the media mogul was still getting to grips with social media. Reports suggested he was forced to quickly delete one post -- possibly after Deng leapt to his aid once again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald -- a fierce rival of his Australian publications -- was among news outlets claiming that Murdoch was guilty of \"tweeting-before-thinking\" for suggesting that the British have too many holidays for a \"broke country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe message was apparently removed, but not before someone tweeting as Wendi Deng implored: \"RUPERT!!! delete tweet!\" A further post on the unverified Deng account later added: \"EVERY1 @rupertmurdoch was only having a joke pROMSIE!!!\" [sic]\n\n\n\n\n\nMurdoch also follows an account that appears on the surface to be Google CEO Larry Page but is actually run by a man in Virginia. It's not clear whether Murdoch realizes he's not following the real Larry Page.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong other tweets by Murdoch, who also follows Zynga CEO Mark Pincus and Silcon Valley entrepreneur and British businessman Alan Sugar, were an expression of support for Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum.", "qa": [{"question": "How many followers does Rupert have?", "answers": ["45,000"]}, {"question": "How many followers does Murdoch have on twitter?", "answers": ["45,000"]}, {"question": "What do his tweets talk about?", "answers": ["politics,", "family, work and politics,", "family, work"]}, {"question": "What is his age?", "answers": ["80-year-old"]}, {"question": "what age is the person?", "answers": ["80-year-old"]}, {"question": "What types of tweets does Murdoch write?", "answers": ["about family, work and politics,", "family, work and politics,"]}, {"question": "Which news channel was this information confirmed to?", "answers": ["CNN"]}, {"question": "What is number of followers Murdoch has?", "answers": ["45,000", "more than 45,000"]}]}

{"text": "(CNN) -- Les Paul never stopped tinkering, said Henry Juszkiewicz.\n\n\n\nLes Paul was constantly making recommendations on how to improve guitars, says the CEO of Gibson.\n\n\n\nJuszkiewicz, the chairman and CEO of Gibson Guitars, remembers getting calls from his company's partner (and famed client), offering recommendations on how to change or market his eponymous Gibson guitars.\n\n\n\nSometimes, Juszkiewicz recalls, the two would go out for Chinese food. Paul was very particular, desiring a dish called Chicken Subgum. The two would have to search Chinatown for a restaurant that knew how to cook it, he says with a chuckle.\n\n\n\nLes Paul died Thursday of pneumonia. He was 94.\n\n\n\nJuszkiewicz talked about his friend and colleague Thursday afternoon. The following is an edited version of the interview.  Watch how Les Paul helped invent modern music \u00bb\n\n\n\nCNN: Tell me about working with Les Paul.\n\n\n\nHenry Juszkiewicz: I've been with Gibson about 25 years and known Les pretty much through that entire period. ... Les was a very kind person. He was a visionary.\n\n\n\nIn the early days, Gibson was doing very poorly as a company, and I got involved essentially to turn the company around. ... We had many, many conversations about the guitar business and what to do. ... A lot of the things we talked about and implemented were very successful.\n\n\n\nCNN: What was distinctive about the Gibson Les Paul when it came out, and what remains distinctive about it?  Gallery: Guitarists pay tribute to Les Paul \u00bb\n\n\n\nJuszkiewicz: When it first came out, it was extremely controversial, and it was not really successful. It took years for Gibson to actually come to terms with Les. He had been pitching the head of what was Gibson's parent company, CMI, for three or four years until they finally decided to give it a try -- and only then when he became very famous and a television personality.\n\n\n\nAnd they were right, actually, because a solid-body guitar was considered silly. ... It really wasn't until 1965, '66 that the guitar took off and became popular. In fact, in the early '60s, the guitar was discontinued for several years. One of the [prized] Les Pauls was the 1959 Les Paul -- that's sort of the holy grail of Les Pauls -- and one of the reasons is there were only 300 units made in 1959. And 300 units was not really that successful for Gibson; it was a powerhouse guitar builder in 1959.\n\n\n\nSo Les was always ahead of his time. He was someone who could see what was going to happen 50 years in advance, and very often, he was able to bring his vision to reality and share it with the entire musical community. ...\n\n\n\nThe [Les Paul] guitar shines in modern music. ... In the '50s and before the '50s, the [standard] guitar was amplified, but it was just louder. In other words, it still sounded just like an acoustic guitar, but you could turn it up. What Les did was turn it into a whole new instrument. When he was playing ... you will hear this rich context that's kind of normal today. ...\n\n\n\nCNN: Les Paul being Les Paul, I assumed he continue to play with things over the years.\n\n\n\nJuszkiewicz: Yeah, he would call me all the time and give me suggestions. It's really hard to answer your original question, what makes it [distinctive]. ... As a guitar player, when I pick it up, I know it's a Les Paul. I can feel the sustain. It's got a certain feeling. ... There's a lot of things in it. But it's the package that's kind of magic. In the modern world, working with modern equipment, it's incomparable.\n\n\n\nCNN: How many Les Pauls do you sell nowadays?\n\n\n\nJuszkiewicz: A lot. Many, many thousands.\n\n\n\nI'll share with you: We had a big debate when we first got involved in the business. When I was a young guitar player, Les Pauls were always very expensive ... and they're very expensive today. [Paul] said, \"You know, Henry, you really have to make a less expensive Les Paul.\" ... We argued about it for a year and a half, and finally I gave in. I said, \"OK, Les, it's your guitar.\" ...\n\n\n\nAnd it was an instant success. And all of a sudden, people that couldn't touch that magic got a shot at it, and he was pleased as punch, and we were as well.\n\n\n\nHe was a renaissance man. ... What a life.

{"text": "United Nations (CNN) -- Confronted with the prospect of a Palestinian bid for full U.N. membership, U.S. President Barack Obama issued a sharp rebuke Wednesday to those pressing for statehood -- a rebuke likely to bring criticism from the Arab world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the U.N.,\" Obama said, addressing delegates at the 66th annual session of U.N. General Assembly. \"If it were that easy, it would have been accomplished by now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States has vowed to block a Palestinian membership application should it reach the Security Council, but is likely eager to head off a scenario that would involve an American veto -- a move widely seen as unpopular across the Middle East.\n\n\n\n\n\nA formal request for full U.N. membership is expected to be submitted Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One year ago, I stood at this podium and called for an independent Palestine,\" Obama added. \"I believed then -- and I believe now -- that the Palestinian people deserve a state of their own. But what I also said is that genuine peace can only be realized between Israelis and Palestinians themselves.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA year later, despite extensive U.S. efforts, \"the parties have not bridged their differences,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American president met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and declared the bonds between their two countries \"unbreakable,\" a move likely to play well at home in an increasingly volatile U.S. political landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough Netanyahu was not in attendance at the General Assembly during Obama's speech, he called the U.S. position a \"badge of honor,\" and has pushed for a resumption of talks, beginning in New York and continuing in Ramallah and Jerusalem.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeace negotiations broke down last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas met with Obama later Wednesday, part of a whirlwind of diplomatic wrangling that has accompanied his proposed move. Obama reiterated his stance on the need for a two-state solution, officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbas met earlier with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who promised the request would be taken \"very seriously,\" according to Nabeel Shaath, a senior negotiator for the Palestine Liberation Organization. Shaath told CNN it had not been decided if the formal application would be submitted the U.N. secretary-general before or after Abbas addresses the General Assembly early Friday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nBan said it will \"not take long\" to get Security Council consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\nShaath added that settling for a lesser status -- such as being recognized as a non-member state -- is one option under consideration if the push for full membership is blocked. But the Palestinians do not want \"anybody to suspect a lack of seriousness,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestinians' current status at the United Nations is as an observer \"entity.\" Observers can speak in the General Assembly but not vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile a veto by the United States in the Security Council would block any effort to gain full U.N. membership, a \"yes\" vote in the General Assembly -- where only a majority would be needed -- would raise Palestinians to the status of permanent observer \"state,\" the status the Vatican currently holds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbas' effort to gain U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state is opposed by Hamas, the Palestinian organization that controls Gaza. It has warned Abbas against making the request, saying it would show a willingness to acknowledge and negotiate with Israel, which would \"deprive the Palestinian people from their right to come back to their homeland.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs national leaders took to rostrum Wednesday to spell out their visions for global peace and security, attention at the U.N. General Assembly seemed to center on the potential membership bid.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy urged the body to recognize Palestine as a non-member state, calling for a more definitive timetable for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. But he also warned that a U.S. veto of the bid for full membership in the Security Council could be dangerous and might spark violence.\n\n\n\n\n\nArgentinean President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner seemed to agree, adding that \"non-inclusion of Palestine (at the United Nations) this year will create greater insecurity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Palestinian leader said he will personally deliver the application to the U.N. Security Council, but does not expect the body to act immediately, according to Palestinian officials.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey say Abbas is expected to deliver the letter before he leaves New York on Friday, but added that he will give both the United Nations and American leadership several weeks to respond to the letter -- temporarily averting a diplomatic showdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbas will wait for a response from the diplomatic Quartet on the Middle East, the officials said, and then return to the U.N. General Assembly to negotiate statehood recognition, working through the U.N. Security Council.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbas' goal, according to the officials, is to legitimize Palestinian statehood by eventually forcing a vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff, who kicked off the opening round of speeches at the assembly's 66th session, joined the chorus of voices on Wednesday calling on the council to approve the Palestinian bid.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer speech marked the first time a woman has commenced the annual proceeding, reflecting a moment of equality at the start of what she described as \"the century of women.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Wednesday, Obama pressed Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan --- an increasingly vocal critic of Israel -- to continue work toward patching up their strained relationship, officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.N. chief, meanwhile, also focused on a series of other issues highlighted during the annual session, particularly the spread of noncommunicable diseases, empowering women, food security and climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth -- these are one and the same fight,\" said Ban. \"Today, I call on you to reach a binding climate change agreement -- an agreement with more ambitious national and global emissions targets.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThirty-one of the world body's 193 delegates are expected to address the assembly this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazil has traditionally opened the session since the days of former American president Harry Truman, when the U.N. was in its infancy.

{"text": "(CNN Student News)  -- Discussion Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n1. When is Black History Month observed? When did Black History Month get its start? Who was Dr. Carter G. Woodson? What was his role in the establishment of Black History Month?\n\n\n\n\n\n2. What are some significant events and milestones in U.S. black history? Who are some of the individuals who have contributed to black history?\n\n\n\n\n\n3. How does black history help to tell the story of what it means to be an American? How have African-Americans enriched that story? What lessons can be learned from the experiences of black history makers?\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activities\n\n\n\n\n\nUse these activities to encourage your students to learn about and appreciate the history, culture and achievements of African-Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. A Milestone in U.S. History\n\n\n\n\n\nRemind students that they have witnessed a truly historical event in their lifetime: the election of Barack Obama as the first African-American president. What will they remember about this milestone? What do they want future generations to know about it? Challenge students to write letters to students who will be in their place 100 years from now, describing the event and its significance for all Americans. Combine the letters into a book or a Web site, or create a video of students reading their letters. Present the finished product to your school's historian or media specialist for archiving.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Covering Black History\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk students: What if CNN correspondents had been on the scene to record key moments in black history for the entire world to see? Organize students into small teams of reporters, and have each team select a time period in American history and a key figure or event that helped to define that time period for African-Americans. Then, have students imagine that CNN was there to cover the historical figure or event. Ask: How do you think that CNN reporters might have covered these stories? Encourage the teams to write scripts for news stories on their historical figures and events. After students have presented their scripts, have them compare their reports to eyewitness accounts and local newspaper reports that were written at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Harlem Renaissance\n\n\n\n\n\nInform students that during the 1920s and 1930s, an African-American cultural movement occurred in the United States that was known as the Harlem Renaissance. It was a literary, musical and artistic explosion that was born in Harlem, New York, and it had a profound impact on African-American culture and on the U.S. as a whole. Have your class host a Harlem Renaissance cultural fair. Direct students to online resources to learn about some of the great artists, writers and musicians who were part of the renaissance and their contribution to this cultural movement.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave each student select one of these African-American artists and design a display that tells about the life and times of the artist and the importance of his or her work. Invite guests from your school and community to attend the exhibit. Have students serve as \"roaming curators\" to instruct and interest guests in the Harlem Renaissance and the creative works of these great African-Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Profiles in Black History\n\n\n\n\n\nDo your students show a personal interest in science, music, politics, theater, sports or education? Inspire them to celebrate the contributions of African-Americans by having them write profiles of African-Americans in the categories that interest them. For example, a budding young scientist might choose to profile the inventor of the ironing board, the lawn mower or the space shuttle retrieval arm, all of whom were/are African-Americans. Direct your students to online and print resources and have them conduct research on their chosen individuals. Then, encourage students to write proposals to have their selected persons commemorated in new postage stamps. Students should accompany their proposals with designs for the stamps. In their presentations, students should try to convince classmates why their profiled persons should have a stamp created in their name. Post the designs around the classroom.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Local African-American History\n\n\n\n\n\nValuable lessons in black history may be found just a few steps away in the stories and documents that can be found in local libraries, historical organizations, universities or colleges, and online. Encourage students to venture out into the community to investigate the history and contributions of black Americans in their city or town. Students might choose to use milestones in black history as a way to organize their research, gathering information on how those events impacted the community and its residents. They may also decide to profile influential black community members. Have students invite community members to a celebration of local black history.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Black History Museum\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrate black history by creating plans for a local Black History Museum. First, have students decide where the museum should be housed. Suggestions might include a school or local library, an exhibit in an existing history museum, or perhaps a virtual online museum. Next, discuss how the museum should be organized. Students may choose to categorize the content by theme, by specific time periods, by specific dates, by people or by local landmarks. Encourage students to include interactive elements and multimedia in their plans. Then, challenge students to consider what people, events or contributions to include in their Black History Museum. Ask: What messages or lessons do you want visitors to take away from the exhibits?\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Not Just for February\n\n\n\n\n\nInform students that, while Dr. Carter G. Woodson chose the month of February to recognize the accomplishments of African-Americans, black history can be celebrated all year long. Challenge students to create year-long calendars or timelines that highlight the contributions of African-American newsmakers, illustrate key events in black history, and encourage an ongoing celebration of black culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nStandards\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Studies\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Time, Continuity, and Change\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of the ways human beings view themselves in and over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nV.

{"text": "(CNN) -- Two goals in five minutes at the start of extra-time helped defending champions Egypt book their place in the African Nations Cup semifinals with a battling 3-1 victory over Cameroon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game, though, was marred by a controversial third goal by midfielder Ahmed Hassan which was allowed to stand by referee Jerome Damon despite replays showing the ball had clearly not crossed the line.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy that time the Pharaohs' captain, who was winning a record 170th cap for his country, had already scored an own goal to put the Indomitable Lions ahead after 26 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nHassan scored again at the other end to pull his side level with a powerful long-range strike before half-time which eventually forced the game into an additional 30 minutes in Benguela.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstitute Mohamed Gedo then capitalized on an error from Geremi Njitap to put Egypt ahead in extra-time, before Hassan's controversial strike handed them a two-goal cushion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make matters worse for Paul Le Guen's Cameroon, Aurelien Chedjou was sent off late on as the north Africans set up a tantalising last-four clash with old foes Algeria.\n\n\n\n\n\nCameroon took the lead following a spell of intense pressure. A succession of Achille Emana corners had the Egyptian defence wobbling -- and the seventh one resulted in Hassan's weak-header on the line dropping into his own net.\n\n\n\n\n\nCameroon pressed for a second goal but were taken by surprise when Hassan unleashed a fierce 35-yard strike in the 37th minute that deceived goalkeeper Carlos Kameni before finding its way in.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmad Moteab could have won the game for Egypt right at the death after he was picked out at the back post by a sweeping pass from Hassan, but the Al-Ahly forward could only find the side netting as the game entered extra-time.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Hassan Shehata's side wasted no time in killing off the tie going 3-1 up after 95 minutes -- after being gifted both goals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first came  when Geremi's poor back-pass from the right was intercepted by Gedo, who and tucked away with ease through the legs of Kameni two minutes after the resumption.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second seems certain to land South African referee Damon in the spotlight after Hassan's free-kick from the left was pushed onto the underside of the crossbar by the Espanyol goalkeeper and did not cross the line when it hit the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it was still allowed to stand much to the dismay of the Cameroon players. It also seemed to knock the stuffing out of Le Guen's men as they failed to create any major openings in the closing 25 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add insult to injury, Chedjou was shown a straight red for hauling down last-man Gedo midway through the second period of extra-time with Egypt going on to seal a memorable win.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria became the fourth team to reach the semifinals after defeating Zambia in a dull final quarterfinal showdown in Lubango.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeither side could find the net after 90 minutes and 30 minutes of extra time, but Nigeria progressed 5-4 on penalties and will now face near-neighbors Ghana in the last four on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoalkeeper Vincent Enyeama scored the decisive penalty for Nigeria after Thomas Nyirenda had missed for Zambia.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnyeama dived to his right to stop Nyirenda's penalty after Sikombe Chivhuta and Christopher Katongo and Emmanuel Mayuka had all scored for Zambia.\n\n\n\n\n\nObefemi Martins, Victor Nsofor, Peter Odemwingie, and John Obi Mikel all scored for Nigeria.", "qa": [{"question": "what did nigeria become", "answers": ["fourth team to reach the semifinals"]}, {"question": "WHo booked their place", "answers": ["Egypt"]}, {"question": "Who does Nigeria play?", "answers": ["Egypt", "will now face", "Ghana"]}, {"question": "Who are the defending champions?", "answers": ["Egypt"]}, {"question": "what did egypt do", "answers": ["their place in the African Nations Cup semifinals with a battling 3-1 victory over Cameroon.", "their place in the African Nations Cup semifinals", "book"]}, {"question": "how many goals did egypt score", "answers": ["3-1", "Two"]}, {"question": "What day was the game", "answers": ["Thursday."]}, {"question": "What is the competition", "answers": ["the African Nations Cup semifinals", "African Nations Cup semifinals"]}, {"question": "Egypt scored how many goals?", "answers": ["Two"]}]}

The company, based in Battle Creek, Michigan, made short order of the already-printed and filled boxes, donating two tons of cereal to the San Francisco Food Bank late last month.\n\n\n\nWith food banks across the country reporting shortages of food, the donation was a welcome one, said the food bank's director of development, Christopher Wiley.

Officials in Washington and Bishkek signed a deal three years ago allowing the United States to renew the arrangement annually through July 2011.\n\n\"We do remain in contact with the government of Kyrgyzstan,\" Yerkin said. \"The Manas Air Base continues to operate under existing agreements, as per the coalition's efforts in Afghanistan.\"\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Friday the United States will continue to work with Kyrgyzstan on keeping the base open.

{"text": "Cleveland, Ohio (CNN) -- The niece of the mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, once lived with murder suspect Anthony Sowell, a registered sex offender charged with murder after the remains of 11 victims were found at his home, a spokeswoman for the mayor said Monday.\n\n\n\nLori Frazier, niece of Mayor Frank Jackson, had a relationship with Sowell that ended two years ago, said Andrea Taylor, a spokeswoman for Jackson's office. Taylor said it is unclear whether the relationship was romantic.\n\n\n\n\"I just want to know why, why he would do this,\" Frazier told CNN affiliate WOIO on Friday. \"He took care of me, good care of me. I never would have thought there were some bodies in the house.\"\n\n\n\n\"I lived with him from 2005 to 2007 and he didn't kill me, but he killed all these girls,\" she said.\n\n\n\nSowell, 50, is facing five counts of aggravated murder, rape, felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with the deaths. All the victims were African-American women. All that remains of one of them is a skull, wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the basement.\n\n\n\nSowell served 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted rape in 1989. He was released in 2005.\n\n\n\nSo far, nine of the 11 victims found at Sowell's home have been identified. The latest two were identified Monday by the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office, police said. They are Janice Webb, 49, and Kim Yvette Smith, who was 43 when last seen. Both women were from Cleveland.\n\n\n\nWebb was last seen on June 3 and was reported missing on August 2, police said. Smith was last seen January 1, but was not reported missing until November 2.\n\n\n\nA grand jury on Monday returned an indictment against Sowell in connection with an alleged assault and rape of a 36-year-old woman September 22, Cuyahoga County prosecutors said in a news release. The investigation into that incident was what led police, armed with a search warrant, to Sowell's home, where they discovered the bodies late last month.\n\n\n\nThe alleged victim encountered Sowell while walking in the neighborhood, and he took her back to his home, where he became violent and raped her, prosecutors said. \"While raping her, he strangled her with a cord until she lost consciousness,\" the statement said. \"When she regained consciousness, he led her out of the house.\"\n\n\n\nSowell faces a charge of attempted murder in the incident, along with two counts of rape, two counts of kidnapping and two counts of felonious assault, authorities said.\n\n\n\nSowell will be arraigned on the new charges Friday, authorities said.\n\n\n\nThe charges are first-degree felonies except for the assault charges, which are second-degree felonies, prosecutors said. If convicted, he would face a sentence of up to life in prison.\n\n\n\nThe investigation into the homicides continues, prosecutor Bill Mason said in the news release.\n\n\n\n\"Upon completion of the investigation, the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office working with the Cleveland Police Department will present evidence to the grand jury seeking the death penalty for these heinous murders committed by Sowell.\"\n\n\n\nResidents of the area near the home said they had noted a smell in the neighborhood, but assumed it was from nearby Ray's Sausage Company.\n\n\n\nAsked whether she had noticed a foul odor, Frazier told WOIO, \"Yeah, I smelled stuff, but he always told me that -- at first he said it was his stepmother downstairs. And then I guess after she left, he told me that it was Ray's Sausage.\"\n\n\n\nFrazier said Sowell brought other women to the home when she was not there.\n\n\n\n\"I love my niece very much and while she has made some decisions that have not been in her best interest, she has my full support,\" Jackson said in a written statement.\n\n\n\n\"As a family, we are extremely fortunate that she was not a victim in this case as she did have a prior relationship with the suspect that ended approximately two years ago. My focus continues to be on making sure the loved ones of the victims get the attention, closure and justice they deserve and it is my hope that everyone remains committed to that goal.\"\n\n\n\nHundreds of Cleveland residents gathered outside the house Sunday night to remember the victims.\n\n\n\n\"It's hard, because I want to burn it down,\" said Inez Fortson, whose daughter Telacia, 31 and a mother of three children, is among the dead.\n\n\n\nSowell has been placed on a suicide watch at the request of his attorney, according to Sowell's public defender, Kathleen DeMetz. A psychiatric evaluation has been ordered but it's unlikely to happen until after the case goes before a grand jury, the next expected step.\n\n\n\nPolice recovered the first bodies after they went to Sowell's home to follow up on a rape accusation.\n\n\n\nIn a separate incident, neighbors on October 20 reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor. Firefighters and paramedics responded, and later notified police. But the woman told officers that she was at the home \"partying,\" when she fell off the roof, and no charges were filed.\n\n\n\nAgents from the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit are assisting Cleveland police, Cleveland FBI spokesman Scott Wilson has said. The agents are preparing a profile of Sowell for police, tracing his life and habits, and his DNA will be entered into a national database to see whether it can be linked to any unsolved crimes.\n\n\n\n\"Our experts tell us it's likely he's done this before,\" said Frank Figliuzzi, special agent in charge of the FBI's Cleveland office. \"He's probably done it elsewhere, and so we need to determine whether or not he's responsible for other unsolved murders and rapes around the country.\"\n\n\n\nIn addition, the FBI is investigating whether Sowell might be linked to crimes abroad, Figliuzzi said.\n\n\n\n\"We know, for example, he was a Marine, he was assigned to California, he served in Okinawa, Japan, and we'll be matching all the facts from these crimes here in Cleveland with the crimes that remain unsolved in our database, and we'll specifically be looking at those locations where he's previously lived.\"\n\n\n\nAllen Sowell, the suspect's half-brother, told CNN he last saw his brother more than 20 years ago. Their stepmother, who lived in the house after Anthony Sowell got out of prison, said she knew of nothing odd going on at the time, Allen Sowell said.\n\n\n\nThe stepmother tried to get Anthony Sowell evicted from the house in 2007 because he wasn't paying rent, Allen Sowell said. Anthony Sowell said he shouldn't have to pay rent on a house that belonged to his father, who died in 2004.  Anthony Sowell remained in the house when his stepmother had to be hospitalized in 2007, his half-brother said.\n\n\n\nAllen Sowell said he was aware of his half-brother's prison record, but \"just couldn't fathom\" the accusations now facing him.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't think he was in that bad of a mental state,\" Allen Sowell said. \"You never think it would happen to your family. It's a horrible feeling.\"\n\n\n\nAt 66, Allen Sowell is 16 years older than his half-brother, and the two didn't meet until Anthony Sowell was 9.\n\n\n\nHe added, \"He deserves whatever he gets from the justice system.\"\n\n\n\nCNN's Susan Candiotti, Edmund Demarche and Ross Levitt and CNN Radio's Brendan Gage contributed to this report.", "qa": [{"question": "What did Frank Jackson say?", "answers": ["\"I just want to know why, why he would do this,\"", "\"I love my niece very much and while she has made some decisions that have not been in her best interest, she has my full support,\"", "\"He took care of me, good care of me.

{"text": "NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Authorities are seeking the public's assistance in identifying a teenage girl who mysteriously turned up in Manhattan two weeks ago, claiming to have no memory of her family, her home -- or even her own name.\n\n\n\nThe teen has recalled an excerpt from the fantasy novel \"Fool's Fate\" by Robin Hobb.\n\n\n\n\"I just want to know who I am,\" the girl says in a statement released by the New York City Administration for Children's Services. The teen, who is being referred to as Jane Doe, continues, \"I want to know who I am and what happened to me.\"\n\n\n\nThe Caucasian young woman, described by New York ACS as \"very soft-spoken,\" is 5 feet, 6 inches tall, light-skinned, with short, straight, cropped blond hair and blue eyes. Doctors are estimating her age to be between 14 and 17.\n\n\n\nACS Commissioner John B. Mattingly appealed to the public in a statement, \"asking anyone who may know this young woman to help us locate her family as quickly as possible, so we can safely reunite her with those who love her.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl was found in midtown Manhattan around 12:30 a.m. October 9 outside the Covenant House youth shelter, although the organization tells CNN that she was not a resident at the time and did not appear as if she intended to seek refuge at the facility.\n\n\n\nAccording to its Web site, with nearly 7,000 youths seeking shelter per year, \"Covenant House New York is the nation's largest adolescent care agency serving homeless, runaway and at-risk youth.\"\n\n\n\nA security guard for the shelter noticed the girl walking around on the sidewalk near Covenant House and approached her. Finding her unresponsive, he called the New York City Police Department.\n\n\n\nPolice officers interviewed the young woman, but it became clear that she couldn't provide authorities with any information about herself. The NYPD said she was wearing military green camouflage pants, a black shirt and a pair of black sneakers when she was discovered.\n\n\n\nChildren's Services said the girl recently wrote down the name \"Amber\" and has responded to it on one occasion, but she has no idea whether it is her true name.\n\n\n\nOn another occasion she is said to have recalled certain words, which turned out to be an excerpt from the fantasy novel \"Fool's Fate\" by Robin Hobb. The girl is also apparently writing a fantasy story of her own that features a heroine named Rian, \"who's been raised by the commander of the guard post on the edge of a fantasy kingdom,\" says the young woman.\n\n\n\nThe girl has a 2- to 4-inch scar on her lower left back and had a black, handwritten birthday message on her arm, addressed to a name of Japanese origin, when she was found, police said Friday.\n\n\n\nJudging from poor dental hygiene, said Lt. Christopher Zimmerman, she appears to have been living on the streets for some time.\n\n\n\n\"This case has been going on since October 9,\" Zimmerman said. \"Today is the 23rd, and we're vey concerned.

{"text": "New York (CNN) -- Decades ago, when the Department of Defense was creating the predecessor to today's Internet, one of the main goals was to create a communications system that could endure catastrophic disasters.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Internet was designed to have no central point of failure, allowing anyone to run his or her own communications channel. This was a system that could withstand a nuclear attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the days since the Haiti earthquake, the popular social networking and microblogging service has been used for rescue efforts and for fundraising to help stabilize and rebuild the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it was big news when Twitter was offline for 90 minutes  Wednesday morning. Technology pundits promptly began hand-wringing -- the weaknesses of having a single point of failure to critical communications had been revealed again! Could we trust Twitter? Did this mean the Web couldn't help us fulfill our most basic obligations to those in need?\n\n\n\n\n\nNot at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's no reason that organizations or individuals who want to use the Web to relay critical information have to rely on Twitter or Facebook or Google or any other giant of the technology industry in the first place. We've just forgotten a bit about how the Internet was supposed to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nRescue organizations and charities should simply be able to use the Web sites they already have to deliver those messages.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd wasn't that the promise of the Web in the first place? Weren't we going to stop relying on individual companies as gatekeepers for communication? When blogs took off a few years ago, wasn't it with the promise that we'd all be able to share our voices without having to ask any company for permission? Why did we give that up?\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe it's because they made it look so easy.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter has done an impressive job of growing to handle its enormous number of users, while keeping its service simple. The company has even shown a reassuring sensitivity to the civic and social obligations that come from running such a popular communication service. Companies such as Facebook and Google have stepped up, too. Their hearts appear to be in the right place, and they're doing real work to help people communicate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Web is bigger than any one site or any one social network. In my own work, I run a nonprofit that strives to connect government policymakers to the expertise of ordinary people using the Web.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'll naturally make great use of Twitter and Facebook and all the other services, but it'd be unforgivable to pick only one of them as a platform for civic engagement. Telling people the only way to talk to the White House is on Facebook is like saying you can only call your senator by using a particular phone company.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that's the key lesson to learn from Twitter being down while people are depending on it for communication: Some needs are too important to put in the hands of any single company. Communicating in real time about emergency information is clearly one of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately there's good news. Smart inventors have already made cutting-edge technologies that let any site deliver messages with the same immediacy as Twitter or Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the challenge is reminding all of the social institutions, media organizations and government agencies that they need to use their own communications infrastructure just as much as they participate in services such as Twitter and Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reality is social networks come and go.\n\n\n\n\n\nTen years ago, otherwise-sensible companies were paying millions of dollars to America Online to buy \"AOL keywords.\" These were shortcuts to parts of the AOL service, which dominated U.S. Internet access at the time. In fact, many of us have allowed companies to become intermediaries to all our communications, whether it was AOL 10 years ago or Facebook today.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we don't need to ask gateways for permission to publish. We can run our own Web sites, at our own Web addresses and keep control over how we communicate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThink how ludicrous it would seem for someone to decide, say, to offer emergency services as an AOL keyword called \"911\" instead of having people just dial their phones?\n\n\n\n\n\nThat sounds absurd, but you can see advertisements today that essentially say \"Find us on Facebook at facebook.com/AcmeWidgets!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, Facebook probably won't fade away entirely, like early networks such as Friendster. But those Facebook addresses are just like AOL keywords 10 years earlier. And it is conceivable that the organizations and companies who communicate on Facebook today may want to become more independent.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether due to emergency or just the everyday requirements of doing business, they ultimately will stop depending on a single point of contact for their communications.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is, after all, how the Web was designed to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe already see governments and civic organizations using the Web as effectively as the best corporations and media. In the United States, we have a White House that's got an iPhone application and a State Department that's asking us to define democracy by responding on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\nJudging by how much technology has affected society already, those first experiments will soon evolve into full-fledged platforms for citizen participation and charitable action. And let's hope they won't have to worry if any one Web site goes down. Because we'll have a web of independent but connected communications systems, just as the Internet was always designed to be.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anil Dash.", "qa": [{"question": "who is anil dash", "answers": ["opinions expressed in this commentary", "The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of"]}, {"question": "What did Anil Dash say the internet was designed for?", "answers": ["to be.", "to have no central point of failure,"]}, {"question": "What does Dash remind us about social networks?", "answers": ["We've just forgotten a bit", "how the Internet was supposed to work."]}]}
{"text": "(CNN) -- A former government contract employee was indicted on charges of stealing restricted nuclear energy-related materials and putting the United States at risk, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.\n\nSources say the classified materials were taken from the East Tennessee Technology Park.\n\nRoy Lynn Oakley, 67, of Roane County, Tennessee, appeared in federal court in Knoxville on Thursday.\n\nOakley was briefly detained for questioning in the case in January, when authorities first learned of the alleged plot to divulge the materials, government sources told CNN. He voluntarily surrendered Thursday at an FBI field office in Knoxville, the sources said.\n\nOakley is a former employee of Bechtel Jacobs, the Department of Energy's prime environmental management contractor at the East Tennessee Technology Park, prosecutors said.\n\nThe indictment states that Oakley, \"having possession of, access to and having been entrusted with sections of 'barriers' and associated hardware used for uranium enrichment through the process of gaseous diffusion ... having reason to believe that such data would be utilized to injure the United States and secure an advantage to a foreign nation, did communicate, transmit and disclose such data to another person.\"\n\nThe transfer took place January 26, the indictment alleges. Oakley is also charged with converting the material and \"restricted data\" to his own use. He began doing so on about October 17, 2006, and continued through January, prosecutors said.\n\nProsecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them.\n\nOakley's attorney, Herb Moncier, said outside court Thursday that Oakley's job was to break rods \"into little pieces\" and throw them away. Moncier said Oakley had a security clearance, but Moncier did not believe it was a high-level clearance.\n\nThe government alleges that in January, Oakley attempted to sell the \"pieces of scrap\" to someone he thought was a French agent -- but in reality was an undercover FBI agent, Moncier said. He said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an \"appliance\" under the law.\n\n\"Mr. Oakley has cooperated fully for the last six months,\" said Moncier, who added that he had traveled to Washington for work on the case.\n\nEach count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\n\"While none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization, the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands,\" Kenneth Wainstein, assistant attorney general for national security, said in the Justice Department statement.\n\nOne government source said the materials involved are not the \"crown jewels,\" but they should not have been taken from the facility.\n\nA \"barrier\" is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process, according to nuclear energy officials, but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job.\n\nSources told CNN that federal authorities have been following Oakley and investigating the case for at least six months, after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material.\n\nOakley, described as a low-level employee, apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind, an official familiar with the case said.\n\nA government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of Oakley's alleged intentions six months ago, the FBI and Department of Energy launched a joint investigation.\n\nThe FBI then developed a sting operation, government officials familiar with the case said, and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country.\n\nEast Tennessee Technology Park is an area of the DOE's Oak Ridge reservation \"where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985,\" Gerald Boyd, manager of the DOE's Oak Ridge site office, said Thursday. \"When they were in use, now over 20 years ago, some of the buildings at ETTP housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium.\"\n\nBoyd said the technology park and the reservation \"are protected by multiple layers of security systems and detection programs, both visible and unseen, meant to identify rogue employees attempting to abuse their access and position.\"\n\nIn this case, a review of security procedures showed that the system worked and \"successfully identified the individual in question,\" he said.

Jackson died June 25 after collapsing at his rented home in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nAEG, promoter of Jackson's planned London, England, shows, released the short video of Jackson rehearsing in the arena on June 23.\n\n\n\nJackson sang \"They Don't Care About Us,\" a song from his \"HIStory\" album, as he danced along with eight male dancers.  Watch Jackson rehearse \u00bb\n\n\n\nJackson did not specify where he wished to be buried in a 2002 will, which was filed in court Wednesday.  Watch CNN's Anderson Cooper talk about his interview with AEG \u00bb\n\n\n\nMore information emerged Thursday about how Jackson's estate will be shared, which his will estimated in 2002 as being worth $500 million.\n\n\n\nThe family trust created by Jackson to receive all of his assets includes his mother, his children and a list of charities, according to a person with direct knowledge of the contents of the trust.\n\n\n\nMother Katherine Jackson's 40 percent share would go to Michael Jackson's three children after her death, the source said.\n\n\n\nThe children -- ages 7, 11 and 12 -- also will share 40 percent of the estate's assets, and the remaining 20 percent will benefit charities designated by the executors of the will, the source said.\n\n\n\nA judge has delayed for a week, until July 13, a hearing to decide whether Katherine Jackson will remain the temporary guardian of Jackson's children.\n\n\n\nAt a brief talk with reporters Thursday, an attorney for Jackson's ex-wife Debbie Rowe said she \"has not reached a final decision\" on whether she will challenge Jackson's mother for custody of Jackson's two oldest children, according to her lawyer.\n\n\n\nA Los Angeles TV station quoted Rowe on Thursday morning saying, \"I want my children.\"\n\n\n\nExcept for the statement to the radio station, she has not publicly indicated whether she would seek custody now that Jackson is dead.\n\n\n\nRowe was left out of the will.\n\n\n\n\"I have intentionally omitted to provide for my former wife, Deborah Rowe Jackson,\" the will said.\n\n\n\nThe will nominated Katherine Jackson, now 79, as the guardian of his children. If Katherine Jackson were to die, \"I nominate Diana Ross as guardian,\" Jackson said in the will, written July 7, 2002.\n\n\n\nSinger Ross, 65, was a lifelong friend of Jackson's.  Watch how the two had a close relationship \u00bb\n\n\n\nThere's also a question on when the will's executors should take over control of the late entertainer's assets, which Judge Mitchell Beckloff temporarily placed under Katherine Jackson's control.\n\n\n\nOne man named as executor is John Branca, who represented Jackson from 1980 until 2006 and was hired again before the singer's death.

The attorney general's office said it will assist police in sifting through information in a state database that monitors controlled medication.\n\n\n\nTwo law enforcement officials separately confirmed the DEA inquiry, saying agents would look at doctors involved with Jackson, their practices and their possible sources of medicine supply.\n\n\n\nNeither official wanted to be identified because they could not comment publicly on the matter.\n\n\n\nOfficially, a DEA spokeswoman referred questions to the Los Angeles Police Department, which would not confirm the involvement.\n\n\n\n\"We routinely offer assistance to any agency regarding the Federal Controlled Substance Act,\" said Sarah Pullen of the DEA. \"However, at this time, we have nothing further to comment about the death of Michael Jackson.\"\n\n\n\nSpeculation about the role of drugs has been swirling since Jackson died June 25 at his rented estate in Holmby Hills. The cause of his death, at age 50, was pending toxicology results.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, police released a car belonging to Jackson's cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray. They had impounded the vehicle Friday, saying it might contain evidence -- possibly prescription medications.\n\n\n\nPolice did not say whether they found anything.\n\n\n\nMurray's attorneys issued a statement, asking the public to reserve judgment about the cause of death until the coroner's tests are complete.\n\n\n\n\"Based on our agreement with Los Angeles investigators, we are waiting on real information to come from viable sources like the Los Angeles medical examiner's office about the death of Michael Jackson,\" the statement said. \"We will not be responding to rumors and innuendo.\"\n\n\n\nNo public showing planned for Neverland\n\n\n\nLogistical and financial challenges derailed earlier plans for a public viewing and private memorial at Neverland Ranch.\n\n\n\nPlanning had been under way for a motorcade to carry Jackson's body from Los Angeles to the Santa Barbara County ranch, which state and local officials suggested would be difficult and costly.\n\n\n\nLaw enforcement sources had said a public viewing at the ranch was under consideration for Friday, but a spokesman for the family said that it would not happen.\n\n\n\n\"Plans are under way regarding a public memorial for Michael Jackson, and we will announce those plans shortly,\" said Ken Sunshine, whose public relations firm had been hired by the Jackson family.\n\n\n\nDespite the announcement, more than two dozen TV satellite trucks lined the narrow two-lane road leading to the ranch.\n\n\n\nFor a time, the California Highway Patrol closed the road to clear up a small bottleneck of cars created by Jackson fans and the media.\n\n\n\nCNN's Drew Griffin, Kathleen Johnston, Michael Carey, Paul Vercammen, Carol Cratty and Kara Finnstrom contributed to this report.", "qa": [{"question": "Who has  joined inquiry into Jackson's death?", "answers": ["family", "The Drug Enforcement Administration"]}, {"question": "Where will the memorial take place?", "answers": ["at Neverland Ranch.", "Neverland Ranch.", "Staples Center in Los Angeles, California,", "the"]}, {"question": "How many days before Jackson's death was the video taken?", "answers": ["two", "his", "he died,", "two nights"]}, {"question": "Where will Jackon's memorial be?", "answers": ["Los Angeles, California,", "Staples Center", "Staples Center in Los Angeles,"]}, {"question": "Who joins the inquiry into Jackson's death?", "answers": ["look at doctors involved with", "The Drug Enforcement Administration"]}, {"question": "How many service tickets will be made available?", "answers": ["20,000-seat", "11,000"]}, {"question": "How many memorial service tickets will be made available?", "answers": ["11,000"]}, {"question": "Whose memorial will be Tuesday?", "answers": ["Michael Jackson's"]}]}

{"text": "(CNN) -- Henry Joseph Madden was a good student and track team member in high school, but he had a secret: He sometimes wore his mother's pantyhose and underwear under his clothes.\n\n\n\nDr. Jennifer Madden, a family physician, began her transition to being female at age 48.\n\n\n\n\"I really wanted to be a girl so bad, and that was one way for me to satisfy those feelings,\" Madden said. \"I always felt like someone was looking over my shoulder.\"\n\n\n\nThe desire to be female never went away. At age 48, Madden confessed these feelings to a doctor, and started seeing a gender therapist who suggested Madden was transgendered.\n\n\n\nThrough reconstructive surgeries, electrolysis, laser procedures and voice lessons, Henry Joseph became Jennifer Elizabeth, known as Jenny. She is a practicing family physician in Nashua, New Hampshire.  Watch Jenny's story \u00bb\n\n\n\nChastity Bono, child of performer Cher and the late entertainer and politician Sonny Bono, announced Thursday the beginning of a transition from female to a male.\n\n\n\nWhile still relatively rare -- one advocate estimates that 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the American population is transgendered -- the idea of changing gender identity has become more widespread in recent years. The term \"LGBT\" (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) is more commonly recognized, and transgendered people have been portrayed in the 1999 film \"Boys Don't Cry\" as well as the 2002 book \"Middlesex\" by Jeffrey Eugenides.\n\n\n\nMany people who have transitioned, including Madden, say they knew they had been born into the wrong gender from childhood. As early as age 3, Dr. Julie Praus, born male, didn't understand why her father wanted to play catch. As a boy, Praus learned how to fish and hunt, but enjoyed collecting Depression-era glassware vases. Praus, 48, a psychiatrist in Brattleboro, Vermont, started living as a woman in March 2008.\n\n\n\n\"I get up every morning and say, 'Wow, I can actually look at myself in the mirror,' because I've never been able to do that in my life, because what would stare back at me was not me,\" Praus said. iReport.com: Share your story of gender change\n\n\n\nDoctors speculate that there is a biological foundation to gender identity, but no one has determined what in the biological makeup determines that gender. The interactions between personality and culture also contribute to identity, said Chris Kraft, clinical director at the Johns Hopkins Sexual Behaviors Consultation Unit.\n\n\n\nThe process of changing genders\n\n\n\nFor people who want a gender change on a biological level, the first step is therapy, experts say. Dr. Gary Alter, a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, California, said patients don't come to him until they've been in therapy, a process that can take as much as a year.\n\n\n\nA therapist then gives a physician approval to start the patient on hormone treatment. At that point, the patient may or may not start living as the chosen sex, Alter said.\n\n\n\nFemales seeking to transition into males may elect to have their breasts removed via surgery. With testosterone, they will grow hair on their face and chest after about two years. Read one man's female-to-male advice to Chaz Bono\n\n\n\nA higher percentage of males transitioning to females will go forward with genital surgery than females going to males, Alter said. Surgical methods for creating a penis -- which range from making one out of the clitoris to using the skin from the forearms -- are \"not perfect,\" and many patients are happy with just chest surgery, he said.\n\n\n\nGenital surgeries for creating female genitalia are better, he said. Alter's method is to make a clitoris out of the head of the penis, and make space for a vagina.\n\n\n\nFacing the rest of the world\n\n\n\nIt is rare for people to undergo a gender transition and then want to reverse it, especially when surgery is involved, experts say.\n\n\n\nSome say changing genders is one of the best things they've done, like Jamison Green, 60, author of \"Becoming a Visible Man,\" who went through chest reconstruction and genital surgery.\n\n\n\n\"I don't have too hard of a time telling people about it,\" Green said. \"I worried about that a lot in the beginning, before there was any kind of community and support about this condition, but one of the things I learned early on was that living in fear and shame is not very healthy.\"\n\n\n\nGreen, who started his transition at age 40, is now happily married to a woman whom he did not know before his change. Praus is also married to a woman, who knew her before her transition. Madden has a boyfriend.\n\n\n\n\"For the longest time, I really felt like I had a mental illness, and I don't feel that way anymore,\" Madden said.\n\n\n\nBut all three have experienced shock and dismay from others around them. Green said his mother took five years to adjust. One of Praus' sons doesn't speak to her. Madden's marriage to a woman ended in divorce during her transition, and her children have struggled.\n\n\n\nYet these three transgendered individuals say they feel better in many ways in their chosen gender roles.\n\n\n\n\"My patients say I'm a better doctor,\" Praus said. \"Some of it is that I'm not exerting so much energy hiding myself.\"\n\n\n\nPsychologists recommend that people who change genders adopt a \"transgendered identity,\" and not keep their history of transition a secret. But some who \"pass\" as their new genders don't want to risk stigma, and tell only people closest to them, Kraft said.\n\n\n\nOften, males who transition to females face more problems than females who become males, Kraft said. Transgendered individuals who start as men tend to face more stigma, particularly if they are more noticeably transgendered.\n\n\n\nTransgendered individuals do face some legal quandaries. Some states require people to show proof of a medical procedure before changing gender on documents such as driver's licenses, while others require that the person has taken hormones, Kraft said. People may also elect to change their birth certificates to reflect chosen gender.\n\n\n\nChastity Bono, who now goes by \"Chaz,\" has been a prominent gay-rights activist.\n\n\n\n\"You could speculate that that could make it more complicated -- when you're a public figure -- to take on something stigmatizing\" such as a gender transition, Kraft said.", "qa": [{"question": "What do doctors speculate?", "answers": ["in the biological makeup determines that gender.", "that there is a biological foundation to gender identity,", "that there is a biological foundation to gender identity, but no one has determined"]}, {"question": "What do people rarely undergo?", "answers": ["a gender transition and then want to reverse it,", "a gender transition and then want to reverse it, especially when surgery is involved,", "to", "rare for"]}, {"question": "What is the estimated percentage of transgendered Americans?", "answers": ["0.25 to 0.5 percent of the", "0.25 to 0.5 percent", "population is"]}, {"question": "What is the percentage of transgender Americans?", "answers": ["0.25 to 0.5 percent"]}, {"question": "What types of people would want to reverse a gender-reassignment surgery?", "answers": ["Transgendered individuals"]}, {"question": "What do doctors speculate as the reason for gender identity?", "answers": ["there is a biological foundation to", "biological foundation to"]}, {"question": "What surgery do people undergo and then rarely want to reverse?", "answers": ["gender transition"]}, {"question": "What proportion of the American population is transgendered?", "answers": ["one advocate estimates that 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the", "estimates that 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the", "0.25 to 0.5 percent", "is"]}, {"question": "Biological foundation is an influence to what?", "answers": ["gender identity,"]}]}

{"text": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Scientists in the United States are developing a \"synthetic tree\" capable of collecting carbon around 1,000 times faster than the real thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nA conceptual design of how the \"synthetic tree\" might look should they ever reach the stage of production.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the wind blows though plastic \"leaves,\" the carbon is trapped in a chamber, compressed and stored as liquid carbon dioxide.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technology is similar to that used to capture carbon from flue stacks at coal-fired power plants, but the difference is that the \"synthetic tree\" can catch carbon anytime, anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Half of your emissions come from small, distributed sources where collection at the site is either impossible or impractical,\" said Professor Klaus Lackner, Ewing-Worzel Professor of Geophysics in the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We aim for applications like gasoline in cars or jet fuel in airplanes. We are going after CO2 that otherwise is nearly impossible to collect,\" he told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the idea of carbon-catchers may sound far-fetched, an early model has been built and Lackner is in the process of writing a proposal for consideration by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe personally explained the concept in a 45-minute meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu last month at a three-day symposium on climate change in London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He was there and I was there and he showed interest,\" Lackner told CNN. \"That's exciting, but I don't particularly want to discuss this in a public forum because I think this gives me a little bit of an opportunity to tailor my proposals to the Department of Energy in a way that makes them more palatable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLackner started working on the concept of an ambient carbon catcher in 1998. \"I argued back then and I still argue that the reason this can be done, from a theoretical point of view, is that the CO2 in the air is actually surprisingly concentrated, therefore the device you need to collect CO2 is quite small.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"synthetic tree\" looks more like a public convenience block than a hi-tech method of reducing carbon emissions, but Lackner told CNN it is highly efficient for its size when compared, for example, to a modern power-generating wind turbine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you give me one of those big windmills which have those big areas through which the rotor moves -- how much CO2 can I avoid? And if I had an equally sized CO2 collector -- how much CO2 can I collect? It turns out the collector is several hundred times better than the windmill.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the \"synthetic tree\" an interesting alternative, or a  scientific flight of fancy that's unlikely to happen? Sound Off below.\n\n\n\n\n\nLackner told CNN that initial concerns over the cost of the technology were focused on the \"front-end\" carbon collector, including the sorbent used to catch the carbon dioxide in the air.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut after years of research, Lackner told CNN he and his colleagues have developed a sorbent that is \"close to the ideal,\" in that it uses a relatively small amount of energy to release the CO2 and is not prohibitively expensive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"By the time we make liquid CO2 we have spent approximately 50 kilojoules [of electricity] per mole of CO2.\" Compare that, Lackner said, to the average power plant in the U.S. which produces one mole of CO2 with every 230 kilojoules of electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In other words, if we simply plugged our device in to the power grid to satisfy its energy needs, for every roughly 1000 kilograms [of carbon dioxide] we collected we would re-emit 200, so 800 we can chalk up as having been successful,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLackner told CNN the biggest cost was at the \"back-end\" of the collector, primarily the technology used to release the CO2 from the sorbent.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said for that reason, on a cost-basis, the \"synthetic tree\" could not compete with modern coal-fired power plants that are designed to release fewer carbon emissions than their older predecessors. But he said when compared to the cost of retro-fitting an existing coal plant, the \"synthetic tree\" becomes more viable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The bottom line is we have in this way the ability to deal with the problem at a cost which is somewhat higher than on a coal-fired power plant retro-fit, but not much higher.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides, he said, the technology is not being developed as an alternative to the carbon capture and storage methods currently being tested for large-scale use on coal-fired power stations. He's targeting carbon that's already in the air.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of the \"synethic tree\" has caught the imagination of one of the first scientists to warn the world about global warming, Lackner's colleague at Columbia University, Newberry Professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Professor Wally Broecker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm extremely excited about this. I think this is something that the world's going to have to have, unfortunately,\" Broecker told CNN from Madrid where he received a BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award for his work on the issue of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nBroecker told CNN most people still don't recognize the magnitude of the task the world faces in reducing global carbon emissions, and it was likely that one day urgent action would need to be taken, above and beyond the current measures being discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're probably not going to stop CO2 rising until it's double what it was near-1800 and maybe even more than that,\" he said. \"I think we will find that the planet is too warm, ice is melting too fast... and we'll want to bring the CO2 back down again. The only way we can do that on a short timescale would be to pull it back out of the atmosphere.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBroecker told CNN the units could stand in the middle of Australia, for example, and their presence wouldn't significantly disrupt the atmospheric distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Each unit would take out a ton of CO2 a day -- which would be the amount of CO2 produced by 20 average automobiles in the U.S.A.

{"text": "(CNN) -- A thin girl with caramel skin and a yellow silk blouse walks alone through a barren landscape of rubble.\n\n\n\nNway prepares for her new job, selling vegetables from her aunt's garden.\n\n\n\nHer legs are marked by cuts. Her face is smeared with white streaks of powder. And her eyes are blank as she sifts through the debris of what used to be her home before Cyclone Nargis slammed into Myanmar one night and swept her parents away.\n\n\n\nHer name is Nway, and that's how she looked when aid workers found her after Nargis destroyed her isolated village. She refused to talk about the cyclone, pretending it never took place. She became, according to a CNN story, the \"girl who refuses to remember.\"\n\n\n\nA year later, an aid worker returned to the village to see how Nway was doing. She found Nway living in a tidy, bamboo house flanked by palm trees. The 8-year-old greeted her visitor with a big smile. Then she asked whether she could play with her visitor's hair.\n\n\n\nPam Sitko, the aid worker, said Nway -- like thousands of people in Myanmar -- is slowly recovering one year after Nargis demolished their country.\n\n\n\n\"After all of her pain and loss, she really is a spunky girl,\" said Sitko, who works with World Vision International, a humanitarian group. \"She wasn't shy about reaching out to touch my blonde hair.\"\n\n\n\nThe night everything changed\n\n\n\nNway's resilience is shared by many in Myanmar, aid workers say.\n\n\n\nLast year's cyclone was catastrophic. It killed at least 140,000 people and left at least 2 million people without homes, according to the United Nations World Food Programme.\n\n\n\nThe brunt of the storm hit Myanmar's delta region, the country's bread basket. It wiped out crops, shrimp farms and fish ponds. A year later, many fields remain unplanted; supplies are short, and the lack of drinking water complicates recovery efforts, World Food Programme officials say.\n\n\n\nYet some sense of normal life is returning, said Mia Marina, a program support manager for World Vision's Nargis response efforts. World Vision is building cyclone-resistant schools and providing supplies to cyclone survivors.\n\n\n\n\"Most of the people are going back to their livelihoods,\" Marina said. \"Kids are going to school. The markets are open.\"\n\n\n\nThe people of Myanmar are also buying planting tools and seed in preparation for the monsoon rains that typically come in May, Sitko said.\n\n\n\n\"Everyone is hoping that this is the moment that it turns around,\" Sitko said. \"It's an exciting time, a time of hope.\"\n\n\n\nThat hope appears to have spread to Nway.\n\n\n\nShe is fortunate to be alive. The cyclone killed her mother and father. The winds were so powerful that they blew away the village buffalo. In Nway's village, 120 people out of a population of 430 people lost their lives.\n\n\n\nNway survived because she was staying with her aunt. The pair joined a group squeezed in to the village headman's house to survive, Sitko said.\n\n\n\nNway wouldn't talk about the cyclone after aid workers found her a month later. She would walk away whenever she was asked about that night. Now, according to Sitko, who wrote about her meeting for World Vision, Nway can talk a little about her loss.\n\n\n\nSitko said Nway shared one memory from the morning after the cyclone while sitting in her aunt's house:\n\n\n\n\"When I walked to my aunt's house that day, my legs were scratched, and I passed lots of dead bodies,\" Nway said. \"I wanted to help, because everyone was working, but I was too scared, so I only helped clean up my auntie's yard.\"\n\n\n\nNway dreams of her future\n\n\n\nNway prefers to talk about other subjects. One is her new job. She helps her aunt sell vegetables from their garden. On most mornings, she smears white powder made from tree bark on her cheeks (it's used as a skin beautifier by women and children in Myanmar). Then she balances a tray of vegetables on her head and walks to a village road to call out to potential customers.\n\n\n\nNway told Sitko that she's made \"four new best friends.\" They like to memorize new words and play hide and seek after school.\n\n\n\n\"I'm always the fastest runner,\" she told Sitko.\n\n\n\nNway is starting to become aware of life outside her village.\n\n\n\n\"She was very proud,\" Sitko said. \"She explained that she had recently taken a trip to another village with her aunties, and she wasn't afraid.\"\n\n\n\nNway doesn't know, though, where she would attend school as she gets older, Sitko said. She'll have to pay to attend school away from her village one day, but her aunt and uncle can't afford the costs.\n\n\n\n\"She wanted to study and said that she was smart,\" Sitko said. \"She said she would be willing to travel to a school outside of her village if she had to.\"\n\n\n\nNway has already taken a more difficult journey.\n\n\n\nThe shocked girl who aid workers met a year ago has changed, Sitko said. Now Nway can remember -- and smile again.\n\n\n\n\"I was expecting a very different girl,\" Sitko said. \"The little girl I met was very confident.

{"text": "(CNN) -- Insurgents locked in a standoff with U.S. Marines tricked them by dressing up as women to escape, a task force spokesman said Monday.\n\n\n\nU.S. Marines scan the site of a blast that hit a U.S. vehicle in southern Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nWomen and children had been caught in the standoff between the armed groups, but some of the women were not what they seemed, according to task force spokesman Capt. William Pelletier.\n\n\n\nAfter the Marines began taking fire from insurgents in the town of Khan Neshin, in south Afghanistan near the Helmand River, the militants ran into a multiple-room compound, the U.S. military said.\n\n\n\nUnsure of whether civilians were inside the compound, the Marines had an interpreter talk to the insurgents, said an official who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly. After some time, a number of women and children left the compound, the military official said.\n\n\n\nThe released hostages told the Marines that there were no more civilians inside the compound, Pelletier said. But the Marines held their fire anyway, the official said. About 4 p.m. (7:30 a.m. ET), in the midst of the standoff, another group of women and children emerged from the compound, the official said. The Marines continued to hold their fire and wait out the insurgents, the official said.\n\n\n\nFinally, a screaming woman emerged from the compound with a bullet wound to her hand, Pelletier said.

{"text": "(CNN) -- Verizon has been touted as having the biggest, baddest, fastest 4G around. It's been this way since the carrier debuted its LTE network in late 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut now that AT&T has joined the LTE game, consumers looking for top speeds might consider turning their focus to AT&T instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf only for a while.\n\n\n\n\n\nMetrico Wireless, a firm that does network and mobile device analytics, took a look at 4G LTE service in the U.S., focusing on two of the nation's largest carriers, Verizon and AT&T.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company's latest report shows that AT&T's average LTE speeds are better than Verizon's (for now at least), and that LTE provides more than five times the performance of the carriers' respective 3G offerings.\n\n\n\n\n\nMetrico used five 4G LTE handsets for its tests: two on AT&T, three on Verizon. On AT&T, the HTC Vivid and Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket were measured. The HTC Thunderbolt, Samsung Droid Charge and Motorola Droid Bionic were tested on Verizon's network.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn stationary download speeds, AT&T's 4G LTE handsets outperformed those on Verizon, but Metrico believes this disparity is likely due to the fact that Verizon's LTE service is more established and has significantly more subscribers using data on it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, as of April, Verizon had over half a million LTE subscribers. AT&T, meanwhile, just launched its LTE network in five markets this summer.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while AT&T's data speeds were better, web pages actually loaded faster on the three Verizon smartphones tested. \"In general, the subscriber experience is not simply driven by the network or the device, but by the combination of the two,\" the report states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even devices with similar specifications connected to similar network technologies still demonstrate variation in performance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was especially true with regards to video performance. Of the smartphones tested, the Samsung Droid Charge (on Verizon) consistently yielded the highest frame delivery rate, while the Motorola Droid Bionic (also on Verizon) had the lowest.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, if you're really concerned about web page load times, consider this: All carrier-to-carrier comparisons notwithstanding, both AT&T and Verizon handsets delivered web page load times that were 80 to 85 percent shorter on LTE relative to 3G.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about battery life on an LTE device, notoriously reported as being poor? Well, depending on how you use your device, you may be able to squeeze out a few more hours, as the report found that battery life was heavily related to app use.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the AT&T Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket, you're going to get 300 to 350 minutes of use out of your device, whether you're a power user or someone who's making calls all day long.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the Verizon Droid Bionic, though, those who primarily use their phones for voice calling will gain about 150 minutes of usage over those who spend most of their time on Twitter and Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nVerizon's LTE network is currently the largest in terms of nationwide coverage, but AT&T's is set to rival it as it expands.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, indeed, we're finally beginning to see LTE infrastructure build-outs, industry-wide. Joining Metro PCS, Verizon and AT&T in the LTE game is Cricket Wireless, perhaps best known for its budget mobile phone and prepaid plan options.\n\n\n\n\n\nCricket will offer speeds up to 6 Mbps with a 5 GB data cap.

{"text": "(CNN) -- Coming back this weekend after a stay in Europe, I had that distinct sensation -- last felt when Lehman Brothers capsized, setting off the Great Recession -- that we once again find ourselves at the mercy of events and people just beyond our control.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere at home, one hears that by Wednesday dawn, we will know whether BP's latest big try to stop the oil spill will work. If it does, we can begin to feel that we are moving in the right direction, but if it doesn't -- well, no one is quite sure what Plan D looks like. Is this really where we have come: that the fate of our precious coastlines and the waters off our coasts are in the hands of a single foreign-based company?\n\n\n\n\n\nA month ago, it looked like the White House was on top of this problem, as Cabinet officers scurried here and there, the Coast Guard and others swung into action, there were talks with BP, and the president paid a personal visit. But increasingly, it has become apparent that the federal government may be present but is not in charge.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt keeps saying that BP bears ultimate responsibility. It is keeping the press away. No wonder James Carville, Chris Matthews and Donna Brazile exploded late last week. They are right on a basic point: Ultimately it is not the responsibility of BP or any other company to protect American interests but the responsibility of the federal government. Some Obama supporters have argued that the 1990 Oil Pollution Act limits the president's capacity to take action. Others disagree. Either way, in an emergency, laws can be changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough this disaster is not an existential threat, it could be argued that if the U.S. government had fought World War II in the same way it has fought the oil spill, we might well be speaking German now. Faced with a growing danger to our well-being, a WWII-type government would at minimum have:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Brought in the CEOs of all the major oil companies and charged them with the duty of an all-hands collaborative effort to stop the spill and help ward off the damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Brought in the best minds in the country, from universities and technology, for emergency efforts to find solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Moved quickly to mobilize the National Guard and other military forces, if necessary, ensuring that they received the resources needed to protect our beaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Made a clear call to citizen volunteers to help where necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Given Cabinet officers an ultimatum: Get this under control in the next 30 days, or else.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be ample time after this disaster for finger-pointing and blame-laying. The key now is to get this spill under control before it does far more damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Washington Post had it exactly right Monday morning when it argued that with the European crisis spreading now beyond Greece, \"the knife-edge psychology currently governing global markets has put the future of the U.S. economic recovery in the hands of politicians in an assortment of European capitals.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross Europe, one finds people stunned at the rapidity with which this crisis has grown, threatening not only their weak economies but also their dreams of a European utopia with people living a honeyed existence. All that could go smash now. Indeed, it is ironic that Europe may now be forced to give up its strong welfare state even as the U.S. is moving toward it. But the immediate point is that the U.S. finds itself too much at the mercy of whether European politicians and publics now make the right moves.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may take a while, but Americans are going to start feeling a lot happier about our country when we once again believe we have strong control of own destiny.

{"text": "(CNN) -- A California movement protesting $1 billion in budget cuts to the state's university system appeared to have burgeoned into a nationwide demonstration on Thursday.\n\n\n\nStudents and professors in dozens of states were challenging administrators and state lawmakers over budget cuts and tuition increases that they say are reducing students' class options and increasing their expenses.\n\n\n\nSome of the demonstrations turned chaotic. In Oakland, California, police arrested 160 protesters who shut down a major freeway, according to city police spokeswoman April McFarland.\n\n\n\nThe Oakland protesters had left a march from the University of California, Berkeley to Oakland City Hall and wound up on the Interstate 980/880 interchange, CNN San Francisco affiliate KGO reported.

{"text": "(CNN) -- After meeting a number black couples in crisis, Nisa Muhammad and Dr. Rozario Slack were inspired to create Basic Training for Couples.\n\n\n\nNisa Muhammad, who founded National Black Marriage Day, co-created the Basic Training for Couples program.\n\n\n\nThe eight-week program educates dating, engaged or married couples about the value of commitment, responsibility to the black community, psychological differences between the sexes, sexual intimacy and conflict resolution.  Slack created the male-friendly portion while Muhammad, who founded National Black Marriage Day and the Wedded Bliss Foundation, created the female-friendly portion.\n\n\n\nIn the program, couples also learn about the history of the African-American marriage and many for the first time plot their own family tree to trace marriage and divorces.  The following is rundown of the eight-week course:  Class No. 1: Why marriage?\n\n\n\nThis class teaches the benefits of marriage for men, women, children and the community. It gives the history of marriage in the black community from slavery when marriage was illegal to today's trends.\n\n\n\nIcebreaker: Q & A: How couples met?\n\n\n\nHomework:\n\n\n\n1. Choose songs to reflect their love for each other\n\n\n\n2. Marriage family tree\n\n\n\nClass No. 2: From I to we; the sweetness of surrender\n\n\n\nThis class helps couples transition from \"I thinking\" to \"we thinking.\" It helps them understand the value of making their marriage a priority in their lives.\n\n\n\nClass No. 3: Communication; getting your message understood\n\n\n\nThis class helps couples take responsibility for their communication and teaches skills to improve their communication techniques.\n\n\n\nMain lessons:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Respecting differences between men and women\n\n\n\n\u2022 Learning to talk to each other and not at each other\n\n\n\n\u2022 Format: Teaching session with dialogue.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Activity: The talking stick, during conversation only the individual holding the stick can speak.\n\n\n\nClass No. 4: Conflict management\n\n\n\nThis class helps couples understand that conflict needs to be managed, or it will manage you. It helps to normalize some conflict that couples experience with the understanding that some conflict cannot be resolved and can only be managed.\n\n\n\nLessons:\n\n\n\n\u2022 This class targets biases. When there's a difference of opinions, generally the stronger spouse wants his or her way.\n\n\n\n\u2022 How to bring closure to old issues instead of combining them into new issues/conflict.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Agree to disagree and not degrade your spouse for having a difference of opinion.\n\n\n\nActivity: Break up into gender groups to discuss current conflicts. The group works out ways to solve the issue\n\n\n\nClass No. 5: Let's make love\n\n\n\nWhen the sex is good in a marriage, it's only about 20 percent of what's going on. When it's bad, it's a significant problem. This class helps to solve some of those problems.\n\n\n\nThe approach was from a physiological and biological perspective of the differences between the male's and female's body. Discussion included chemical bonding effect in women and men.\n\n\n\nClass No. 6: From yours and mine to ours\n\n\n\nMany couples in the black community bring children from other relationships to their marriage. This class helps to blend the family into one cohesive unit. It also talks about preventing in-laws from becoming outlaws.\n\n\n\nClass No. 7: Keeping the FIRE burning\n\n\n\nFIRE is an acronym for Faithful, Intimacy, Responsibility and Excitement. This class helps couples maintain the FIRE in their relationship.\n\n\n\nClass No. 8: From this day forward\n\n\n\nThis class helps couples understand the value of commitment in their marriage and never to make divorce an option. They create their own place for success.\n\n\n\nRecap of all the lessons together:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Remembering people gravitate to the applause \u2022 Ways to appreciate and affirm your spouse \u2022 Setting time for just the two of you \u2022 Learning to communicate, getting your message heard and understood\n\n\n\nBonus class: Hot monogamy\n\n\n\nGets couples comfortable to discuss sex with their spouse.\n\n\n\nGraduation\n\n\n\nA ceremony of new beginnings, couples testify what the class brought to their marriage over the eight-week period.

The worst drought in half a century has turned Argentina's once-fertile soil to dust and pushed the country into a state of emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\nArgentine farmers profited in years past from selling beef to the world, but some now struggle to feed their cattle.\n\n\n\n\n\nCow carcasses litter the prairie fields and sun-scorched soy plants wither under the South American summer sun. Farmers are concerned about their livelihoods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm losing money. I can't afford to lose money all the time,\" said Juan Cahen D'Anvers, whose family has been farming in Argentina since the late 1700s. He owns 700 hectares (1,730 acres) in San Miguel del Monte, where he grows sunflowers and barley.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says this year is one of the hardest he's ever had.  Watch farmer explain how hard he's been hit \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Production is going to go down a minimum of 50 percent, maybe more. I don't know yet,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nArgentina is one of the world's breadbaskets, providing commodities such as soy, wheat, corn and beef to countries around the globe. In recent years, record-high prices for these products reaped millions of dollars for Argentine farmers, but since the global economic crisis hit, demand and profits have dropped. Now the drought is making matters even worse.\n\n\n\n\n\nCesar Gioia, another San Miguel del Monte farmer, said time is growing short.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If it doesn't rain in the next 10 days, I will have to wipe out my entire corn crop, 90 hectares (220 acres),\" he said. \"The best I can do with it is feed it to my cows.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFacing pressure from farmers, Argentina President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced emergency measures this week that will exempt the worst-hit farmers from paying most taxes for one year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a big boost of patriotism, and a sign of support from all Argentines,\" Kirchner said on January 26. \"All other sectors of the economy will continue to contribute, so we can help the farmers who have been affected by this drought.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKirchner has had a contentious relationship with farmers, who staged noisy protests and strikes last year over an increase in export taxes. Those taxes eventually were reduced, but farming leaders still contend that the government is out of touch with their needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey say the measures announced this week fall short, and are demanding a cohesive, long-term plan for dealing with emergencies such as the current drought. If not, they say, they may strike again.  Watch how farmers reacted to Kirchner's move \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sure, this plan is approved now, and it helps, but we need money to feed cows, to go back to planting crops, because this drought is impacting life in every sector of society,\" said Eduardo Buzzi of the Argentine Agrarian Federation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs she yanks dead soy plant vines from a dusty field in San Miguel del Monte, Lorena del Rios of the Argentina Rural Society says she expects the drought to affect both Argentine and overseas consumers, especially when it comes to Argentina's world-famous beef.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will see less meat available, which means rising prices,\" she said. \"There is even the possibility that in a few years Argentina will have to import beef, which is almost unthinkable for people here.\"", "qa": [{"question": "Where is the drought hitting?", "answers": ["Argentina"]}, {"question": "What litters the plants?", "answers": ["Cow carcasses"]}, {"question": "How long has it been since the last drought this severe?", "answers": ["half a century"]}, {"question": "Where did the drought hit?", "answers": ["of Buenos Aires,", "Buenos Aires,", "Argentina", "small farming town 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest"]}]}

Let me count the ways ...\n\n\n\nRyan Reynolds wonders if marrying his boss, Sandra Bullock, is a good thing in \"The Proposal.\"\n\n\n\nSomething old: The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other -- until they realize they love each other -- is proudly square, in the tradition of rom-coms from the 1940s and '50s. Or is it straight out of Shakespeare's 1590s?\n\n\n\nSandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get ... loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual.\n\n\n\nAnd there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret's fatal flaw -- she's Canadian. (So is \"X-Men's\" Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.)\n\n\n\nMargaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It's an offer the underling can't refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie's mood.)\n\n\n\nOK, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be's family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue.\n\n\n\nSomething new: The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s, Bullock has finessed her dewy America's Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature, pearly texture; she's lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos, and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe.\n\n\n\nReynolds, meanwhile, is just refining his dry comedy thing, learning to get the most from his deceptive cute-face looks.\n\n\n\nWho knew these two would, hmmm, complete each other? Working together, both are surer and more disciplined in delivering their comedy goods. iReport.com: \"Proposal\" has \"plenty of laughs\"\n\n\n\nSomething borrowed: The boisterous family dynamics. The eccentric supporting players (none more extreme than Oscar Nunez from \"The Office\"). The snappy screwball dialogue in Pete Chiarelli's script. And the way Anne Fletcher directs like a camp counselor wrangling bunkmates ... it's all been seen before. For a reason. These elements work.\n\n\n\nSomething blue: As the wise and saucy matriarch of the family, the divine 87-year-old Betty White has fun as one hot grandma -- and inspires her younger stars to say \"I do,\" too.\n\n\n\nEW Grade: B+\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly", "qa": [{"question": "EW: \"The Proposal\" is a top-notch what?", "answers": ["romantic comedy"]}, {"question": "What is a top-notch romantic comedy?", "answers": ["\"The Proposal\""]}, {"question": "What adheres to formula, but it's well done, very funny ?", "answers": ["\"The Proposal\""]}, {"question": "What does the movie adhere to?", "answers": ["the charming, traditional romantic comedy", "rom-coms"]}, {"question": "The movie adheres to what?", "answers": ["checklist of a charming, traditional bride?", "traditional romantic comedy"]}]}

{"text": "(CNN) -- Arsenal climbed to the top of the English Premier League with a 2-0 victory over London rivals West Ham despite playing half of Saturday's clash with only 10 men.\n\n\n\n\n\nArsene Wenger's team moved a point above champions Manchester United, who host Liverpool on Sunday, while Chelsea dropped to third ahead of their trip to Blackburn. Carlo Ancelotti's side can join Arsenal on 67 points with victory in that game.\n\n\n\n\n\nGianfranco Zola's West Ham team were left to rue a missed penalty as the defeat left them just three points above the relegation zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nArsenal, who on Friday were handed a chance to avenge 2006's Champions League final defeat by Barcelona in the upcoming quarterfinals, took the lead after just five minutes in the rain at the Emirates Stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazil midfielder Denilson fired in a low shot for his sixth goal this season, having dispossessed Valon Behrami and then played a neat one-two on the edge of the area with striker Nicklas Bendtner.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Arsenal could not turn their dominance into further goals, and West Ham should have leveled just before halftime when Belgium defender Thomas Vermaelen was sent off as his nudge in the back of Guillermo Franco saw the Mexico striker tumble in the box.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Alessandro Diamanti saw his penalty saved by Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, and the hosts also escaped in the second half when substitute striker Carlton Cole saw his fierce low shot hit the outside of the post.\n\n\n\n\n\nArsenal captain Cesc Fabregas made the points safe on his return from injury five minutes after that with a penalty on 82, as England defender Matthew Upson paid the price for deliberately blocking the Spain midfielder's clever little flick with his arm.\n\n\n\n\n\nTottenham consolidated fourth place with a hard-fought 2-1 victory at 10-man Stoke, as substitute Eidur Gudjohnsen came off the bench to put the London club ahead before Dean Whitehead was sent off and then helped set up Niko Kranjcar's 77th-minute winner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe on-loan Iceland forward netted just 18 seconds after halftime having come on for Roman Pavlyuchenko, who joined England striker Jermain Defoe on the injured list after suffering a hamstring problem in the first half.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitehead went three minutes later for his second booking, but Stoke leveled on 64 as winger Matthew Etherington scored from the penalty spot against his former club after fullback Benoit Assou-Ekotto fouled striker Paul Kitson.\n\n\n\n\n\nGudjohnsen's dummy allowed Croatia midfielder Kranjcar to put the Londoners four points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool, who will have played one more match after Sunday's trip to bitter North-West rivals United.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe victory was doubly important for Tottenham after fellow Champions League hopefuls Aston Villa had to come from behind to snatch a 2-2 draw with lowly Wolverhampton in the Midlands derby earlier on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Carew put Villa ahead in the 16th minute despite appearing to be offside, and the Norway striker salvaged a point for the hosts with eight minutes remaining as he steered Steve Sidwell's low shot into the visitors' net for his 13th league goal this season.\n\n\n\n\n\nWolves moved four points clear of the bottom three, but were denied a first win at Villa Park in 30 years despite Jody Craddock's bundled 23rd-minute equalizer and an own-goal from England international James Milner seven minutes before halftime.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result left Villa in seventh, having played one less game than Tottenham, equal on 50 points with Manchester City, who travel to Fulham on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nEverton moved above Birmingham into eighth place with a 2-0 win at home to Bolton, who had Gretar Steinsson sent off in the 71st minute for bringing down Nigeria striker Yakubu.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanish midfielder Mikel Arteta fired in the resulting freekick and South Africa international Steven Pienaar wrapped up victory with a minute to go after Leon Osman hit the crossbar.\n\n\n\n\n\nBirmingham crashed 3-1 at Sunderland, who eased their relegation worries as England World Cup hopeful Darren Bent scored twice in the first 11 minutes to take his Premier League tally to 20 goals this season and 21 overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nWigan moved seven points clear of the bottom three with a 1-0 win over Burnley, as Colombia striker Hugo Rodallega's 90th-minute header left the visitors deep in relegation trouble after a 15th defeat in 16 away matches.\n\n\n\n\n\nHull remain second from bottom, behind Burnley on goal difference, as new manager Iain Dowie suffered a heartbreaking 3-2 defeat at basement club Portsmouth in his match in charge.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visitors led 2-1 with 17 minutes to play after two goals from striker Caleb Folan, but Portsmouth's on-loan midfielder Jamie O'Hara leveled in the 88th minute with a curled

They're calling it \"Two Kids, One Hall.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They could only fit two-and-a-half of us,\" he says, \"So we fired two-and-a-half, and the other guy didn't want to come as a half. After some contract negotiation, it became Scott and I.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLongtime fans of the legendary Canadian sketch comedy group know the full cast as also including Dave Foley, Bruce McCulloch and Mark McKinney. (McDonald didn't specify which of these three was asked to be half a man on the tour, but the smart money is on Foley.)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1989 to 1995, the Kids in the Hall enjoyed TV success, and many of their sketches and phrases have become a part of pop culture lore. For instance, if you've ever crushed somebody's head, you, sir, have enjoyed a Kids in the Hall moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's plenty more from their catalog of absurdity, and you can pretty much find them all somewhere on the Interwebs. But if you're looking for a place to start, this author's personal favorite is a sketch called \"Citizen Kane.\" And my friend Paul favors one called \"Wrong Number.\" So, here, now, you have some Kids in the Hall advice from somebody named Paul, and somebody with the last name Bellini.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to touch us.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being known for their sketches, the current Scott Thompson/Kevin McDonald tour is actually more focused on stand-up comedy.

But the chemistry between the two comedians comes out best when they share the stage during moments throughout the show. And it certainly came out when we sat down with them in Atlanta before their performances at The Punchline. As you'll see in our video, Thompson and McDonald feed off each other with ease, often completing each other's thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\nCertainly, like all comedy, the Kids in the Hall aren't for everyone, but there's no denying their success; especially if catching the eye of a young Uma Thurman is the barometer of that success.\n\n\n\n\n\nThompson recalls meeting her backstage after a show early in the group's career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Uma Thurman at the time was the sexiest woman in the world,\" he says. \"We had never met a celebrity before.

It was a tough five months,\" Kevin's father, Heiko, told CNN affiliate WSET, from the family home in Lynchburg, Virginia. \"I'm just so happy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHeiko Lunsmann said the boy had plotted his escape for a while and eventually seized the opportunity some time late last week while his guards slept.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe \"was spotted alone\" Saturday about six miles southwest of Lamitan City on the island of Basilan, a stronghold of the Islamic militant group Abu Sayyaf, the official Philippines News Agency said.\n\n\n\n\n\nArmy officials turned him over to American forces in the southern Mindanao region, the Philippine government said in a statement to CNN affiliate TV 5.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Philippine Inquirer quoted the Lamitan city mayor, Roderick Furigay, as saying Kevin walked for two days, surviving on candies his captors presumably gave him and on coconuts that he retrieved by climbing trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In this holiday season nothing makes me happier than knowing that an innocent victim is returned to his family in time for holiday celebrations,\" Harry Thomas, the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, said in a weekend statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If ever we are to be inspired by the human spirit, we should take comfort in the courage, commitment and love that the Lunsmann family exhibited during this trying ordeal,\" Thomas added.\n\n\n\n\n\nFourteen gunmen snatched Kevin, his mother, Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann, and his 19-year-old cousin, Romnick Jakaria, in July while they vacationed on the island of Tictabon, authorities said. The abductors forced them to board awaiting boats, which then sped off in the direction of Basilan.\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin's mother was released by her captors in October.

{"text": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- While the Oscars is without doubt the grandest of all the awards ceremonies, it doesn't have the world stage to itself.\n\n\n\n\"Persepolis\" won the French nomination -- but failed to make the Academy's shortlist\n\n\n\nIn London, the Brits have their BAFTAs; Spain has the Goyas; and France celebrates the Cesars, where \"La Vie En Rose\" won six out of its \"magnifique\" 11 nominations. And it was this foreign fare that gave rise to the biggest controversy at Hollywood's big event.\n\n\n\n\"La Vie En Rose\" amassed an impressive eleven nominations at the French Cesar Awards. Marion Cotillard's astonishing transformation into Edith Piaf won her Best Actress gongs at the Golden Globes, BAFTAs and the Academy Awards. But \"La Vie En Rose\" was not among the contenders for Best Foreign Film.\n\n\n\nAnother French language film, \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,\" was on many critics' top ten lists for the films of 2007. It won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film and its American director Julian Schnabel was nominated for an Oscar. But like \"La Vie En Rose,\" this film was not among the contenders for Best Foreign Film.\n\n\n\nA third French film, \"Persepolis\" won the special jury prize at Cannes and it received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature, but yet again, this was not a nominee for Best Foreign Film.\n\n\n\nFrance suffered through an abundance of riches this year, with three potential Oscar winners. But to enter the race for Best Foreign film, France, like every other country, had to nominate just one.\n\n\n\nSo \"La Vie En Rose\" and \"Diving Bell\" were rejected by the French film authorities in favor of \"Persepolis.\" But \"Persepolis\" didn't sufficiently impress the Oscar judges: so France had no films among the final five nominees.\n\n\n\nFrench frustration at the Oscar process was echoed in Taiwan, which chose Ang Lee's film, \"Lust Caution,\" as its official entry. The film won both critical acclaim and the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. But Oscar judges ruled there was too little Taiwanese involvement -- none of the lead actors are from Taiwan. The double Oscar winning director watched in disbelief as his film was banned and Taiwan was told to pick another film instead: Oscar caution triumphing over Ang Lee's lust for a third Academy Award.\n\n\n\nAnd the list goes on: the Israeli film, \"The Band's Visit\" was excluded for having too much English -- but it's the only way the Israeli and Egyptian protagonists can communicate in the film and is a key part of the plot. But Israel submitted \"Beaufort\" instead -- and made the final five.\n\n\n\n\"The Kite Runner\" may have proved an international success at the box office, but it didn't fly with Oscar watchdogs. Set in Afghanistan with Farsi as its main language, it fell foul of the rulebook by having too little Afghan involvement and a Swiss-American director.\n\n\n\nBut for most critics, the most inexplicable omission from the shortlist of nominees was Romania's \"4 Months, 3 weeks & 2 Days,\" winner of the Palme D'Or in Cannes and considered by many to be a sure-fire Oscar winner. Some feel its challenging subject of a back-street abortion in communist Romania was too testing for conservative members of the Academy's Foreign Film Committee, whose volunteers tend to include many retirees -- who else has time to attend screenings of 63 foreign language films?\n\n\n\nEven Marc Johnson, the Chairman of the Academy's Foreign Language Film Committee, acknowledged that some of the criticism levelled against the Academy this year was \"justifiable\".\n\n\n\nHe told CNN: \"We took quite a beating, and I think quite justifiably, not for the films that we selected but for the films that we DIDN'T select.\n\n\n\n\"And I felt very passionately about it and spoke out about it more than I should have done, but there was a part of me saying \"wait a minute I didn't sign on for this -- I didn't sign on to be the scapegoat and we received a lot of criticism and yet it's something I feel so passionately about I think foreign language film and particularly subtitled film in the U.S. are really an endangered species.\"\n\n\n\nDefenders of the Academy also point out that they're only asking countries to nominate their favorite film; they then pick the best of that bunch.\n\n\n\nMr Johnson said it would be unfair to allow countries to submit more than one film as the selection process would become \"unmanageable\".\n\n\n\n\"There have been arguments that why can't a coutnry submit more films? France for instance might argue we make 50 films a year, maybe five of them are Oscar worthy and Ecuador maybe only makes one why is it we have the same group as they?\" .\n\n\n\n\"Not that I ever like to mix sports with the arts but it's a little bit like the World Cup. Brazil could probably submit five teams but they're only allowed to submit one -- and it's what makes it a fair race,\" he explains.\n\n\n\n\"The other thing is quite frankly this year we had 63 films. We could not see many more than that. So if we had 5 from this country and 3 from this country it would be completely unmanageable.\"\n\n\n\nAnd while the one-film-per-country rule fails to reward a nation with a flourishing film industry, it does ensure diversity: no less than 63 countries from Azerbaijan to Vietnam submitted films for the 80th Academy Awards.\n\n\n\nIsrael, Austria, Poland, Russia, and Kazakhstan -- representing 210 million people in all -- were the countries vying for the prize on Oscar night, and the Academy points to the quality of those on the list, rather those that are not, as ultimate proof that the system works.

{"text": "Willow, Alaska (CNN) -- The 2010 Iditarod is officially under way, with 71 mushers and dog teams on the wide-open trail toward Nome.\n\n\n\nTeams will spend the next week and a half crossing 1,049 miles through some of the most demanding and formidable conditions on Earth, including North America's largest mountain chain, the Alaska range.\n\n\n\n\"Ten days and nothing else but eat, sleep and feed dogs,\" Canadian musher Sebastian Schnuelle said excitedly.\n\n\n\nThe sport has been dominated in recent years by Lance Mackey, 39, of Fairbanks, Alaska, and this year he will be trying to accomplish what no musher in history has been able to do: win four consecutive Iditarods.\n\n\n\nMackey is a throat cancer survivor and is known for his fierce determination and competitive spirit.\n\n\n\nHe comes from family of Alaskan mushing champions. His father, Dick Mackey, and brother Rick have also won the Iditarod. Dick Mackey's one-second win over Rick Swenson in 1978 set a record for the closest finish in Iditarod history.\n\n\n\nThe Iditarod, though, isn't a competitive sprint to the finish for every musher in the field. Jim Lanier, 69, of Chugiak, Alaska, mushes primarily for enjoyment. He's entered and completed 13 Iditarods, at least one in all four decades the race has been in existence. He has never won.\n\n\n\nRookie Iditarod musher Kristy Berington admits that she's not racing to win; she just hopes to finish. Her longest race prior to entering this year's Iditarod was only 300 miles.\n\n\n\n\"I've got puppies on this team that I want to see get to Nome. It's like watching your kid graduate from college,\" said the 25-year-old Kasilof, Alaska, resident. \"They go and they're puppies, and they come back and they're dogs.\"\n\n\n\nShe has been training with Iditarod veteran Paul Gebhardt and has borrowed one of his dog teams to lead her to Nome.\n\n\n\nOutside of personal accomplishments and goals, the race this year also presents an opportunity for some mushers to show their respect to fallen serviceman, thanks to a collaboration with the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors.\n\n\n\nAlways a top competitor in the race, four-time Iditarod champion Martin Buser of Big Lake, Alaska, has six commemorative purple ribbons attached to his sled this year, placed there at the ceremonial start by the wives of the fallen soldiers and officers.\n\n\n\nBuser, who was born in Switzerland in 1958, became a U.S. citizen in 2002.\n\n\n\n\"After the 9/11 incident, I proved to my boys that this is the soil I wanted to defend ... so being asked to do such honors as these are very, very important to me because I'm truly one of the new immigrants and one of the staunches believers in our country,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBuser was naturalized under the famous burled arch in Nome at the finish line of the 2002 Iditarod. He carried an American flag in his sled for more than 1,000 miles to the finish line that year and set an Iditarod record for the shortest race time ever recorded: 8 days, 22 hours, 46 minutes and 2 seconds.\n\n\n\nHis two sons are even named after Iditarod checkpoints: Nikolai and Rohn.\n\n\n\nThe 2010 Iditarod musher's roster includes men and women ages 18 to 69 who hail from five countries: the United States, Canada, Scotland, Belgium and Jamaica. Some are professional mushers who raise and train sled dogs year-round; others are teachers, nurses, horse trainers, foresters or biologists. A doctor and a fishing guide also are included, among other professions.\n\n\n\nAsked to explain why mushers are drawn to this sport, four-time Iditarod champion Jeff King of Denali Park, Alaska, took time to reflect before answering.\n\n\n\n\"Until you've ridden a dog team you've trained from puppies on a full moon with a hard trail and feel their energy and hear the panting of their tongues, the jingle of their collars, feel the surge of power that comes through the handlebar, I don't think you can appreciate what it's really like,\" the 54-year-old said. \"But that's exactly the reason.\"", "qa": [{"question": "Lance mackey will try for what win?", "answers": ["four consecutive Iditarods."]}, {"question": "Who will be trying for his fourth consecutive win?", "answers": ["Lance Mackey,"]}, {"question": "The Alaskan sled dog race begins with how many teams?", "answers": ["71", "71 mushers and"]}, {"question": "what year of the dog sled race is this?", "answers": ["2010"]}, {"question": "who is going for their fourth win?", "answers": ["Lance Mackey,"]}, {"question": "how many teams will start the race?", "answers": ["71"]}, {"question": "how many teams will start?", "answers": ["71"]}]}
{"text": "(CNN) -- William Beach was one of those people who fixated on certain foods. He would eat the same thing voraciously for a few days, and then, when he tired of the same tastes, he moved onto something else.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August, when summer's heat seemed unending in Mustang, Oklahoma, Beach took to savoring fried chicken -- and soft, sweet cantaloupe.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeach was elderly -- 87 -- but after eating the fruit, his health declined rather suddenly and before anyone in his family knew what was wrong, he was dead.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is among 15 people who died from Listeria monocytogenes in what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is calling the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998.\n\n\n\n\n\nGallery: The decade's 10 biggest food-borne illness outbreaks\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bacteria was traced to Rocky Ford cantaloupes grown at Jensen Farms' fields in Granada, Colorado. As of Monday, the outbreak had affected people in 19 states.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CDC first reported it publicly on September 12, six days after William Beach's family buried him.\n\n\n\n\n\nListeria? What's that?\n\n\n\n\n\nBeach and his wife Monette bought the tainted cantaloupe at a Homeland grocery, where the store motto says: \"the best is fresh.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA week after he ate the fruit, Beach felt malaise, perhaps not unusual for a man of 87 years. But then his face turned the shade of a tomato. Soon he had trouble breathing and collapsed on the living room floor, according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed against Jensen Farms.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonette heard him struggling to pull himself up off the floor.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe hobbled into the room with her cane and saw her husband of 67 years unable to speak, unable to get up.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe dialed 911 and an ambulance whisked Beach to Baptist Hospital in nearby Oklahoma City. He was discharged the next day but when he got worse at home, he returned to the hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of Beach's six daughters, Brenda Hathaway met her father at the emergency room. Beach told her he didn't want Monette to see him this way.\n\n\n\n\n\nListeriosis causes fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. It is rarely a serious concern for healthy children and adults, according to the CDC, but it is particularly dangerous for pregnant women and the elderly or people with weakened immune systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the evening of September 1, medical staff tried to intubate Beach but he began hemorrhaging from the mouth and nose, the court documents said. Soon after, he died.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonette never saw her husband alive again. Two days after his funeral, an official from the Oklahoma State Department of Health called Hathaway.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was told then that her father had tested positive for Listeria.\n\n\n\n\n\nHathaway's sister Debbie Frederick said the family wondered why it took the hospital two days to release her father's body. They had assumed he died of natural causes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We knew it was some sort of infection, but we did not know what it was,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Listeria? She had never even heard that word before.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you need to know about Listeria\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth officials began questioning Beach's daughters. What had he eaten in the weeks prior? They specifically asked if he had consumed cantaloupes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrederick, meanwhile, glued herself to her computer, determined to learn more about the illness that killed her father.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Doing all that reading, it became patently clear that the health departments knew there was an issue,\" she said. \"They knew there was a Listeria problem.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Beach family's angst led to a lawsuit filed against Jensen Farms. Frederick said she hopes the lawsuit will help strengthen food safety laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a terrible thing to lose someone you love to something that could be prevented,\" she said. \"I pray that it's over. I hope nobody else has to lose a loved one.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBattling the bacteria\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Littleton, Colorado, Jeni Exley's parents, Herbert and Elaine Stevens, were getting ready to celebrate 60 years of marriage on September 8.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey still had a good life together. Despite his age -- 84 -- he felt spry enough to take the dogs out for a walk in their Littleton neighborhood. He let Elaine do most of the grocery shopping and cooking but he could make his own sandwiches for lunch.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to keep your food safe\n\n\n\n\n\nIn early August, Elaine came home from the nearby King Soopers market with half a Jensen Farms cantaloupe. She didn't buy the whole thing -- it was only the two of them. Besides, she liked to able to see through the cellophane and decide if it was ripe enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe and Herbert both ate the lush fruit. Herbert started to feel sick, just like William Beach.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour days before Beach was rushed to hospital in Oklahama, Stevens couldn't get up from the toilet in Colorado. He had a fever of 103 degrees and felt nauseous.\n\n\n\n\n\nElaine called an ambulance which ferried her husband to Littleton Adventist Hospital. Unlike the Beach family, Stevens' daughters learned after a few days that their father was infected with Listeria.\n\n\n\n\n\nExley, 55, like Frederick, went online to learn more about the bacteria that had sickened her father. Health officials, after questioning Elaine about what the couple had eaten in the last few weeks, determined that Herbert Stevens was a part of the latest outbreak.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter antibiotic therapy, Stevens was transferred to a nursing home. Exley arrived on her parents anniversary with chocolate milkshakes in hand. But her father wasn't feeling well. He was sent back to the hospital when his condition worsened.\n\n\n\n\n\nStevens eventually regained some of his strength. He was sent to a skilled nursing facility to recuperate on September 19, the same day that the Food and Drug Administration announced it had found Listeria monocytogenes in samples of Jensen Farms' Rocky Ford cantaloupes.\n\n\n\n\n\nStevens' Listeria is gone but at that age, he will probably never return to the man he was, Exley said. A little bit of him went with his bout with the bacteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe uses a walker now to move around; all his body functions seem affected, Exley said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it is amazing that he even survived,\" she said. \"I am surprised he is not one of those people who died.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stevens are also suing Jensen Farms in hopes of recouping some of their medical costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nExley, who loves cantaloupe, feels extremely lucky her family escaped tragedy. She, too, had bought some of the tainted fruit and received an automated phone call at home warning her about the recall.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe, like Frederick, thought she could trust what she was buying at the neighborhood grocery store. From now on, she will think twice.

{"text": "Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- After the Republicans and Democrats met at the White House summit on health care, it was clear that the parties are very far away from a bipartisan agreement. Indeed, few participants walked away with the sense that they were any closer to a deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House did make clear that it was willing to move forward on health care without Republican support. The choice now becomes whether Democrats should use the budget reconciliation process to pass some parts of health care legislation. According to recent reports, Democrats are considering having the House pass the bill that was already approved in the Senate and then dealing with a package of additional reforms through reconciliation.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrograms that are considered under the reconciliation process are not subject to a Senate filibuster. Democrats would only need 51 votes, not 60, to pass those parts of the bill that are included under reconciliation.\n\n\n\n\n\nReconciliation was created through the Budget Reform Act of 1974 in an effort to streamline the budget process, strengthen the ability of Congress to make tough decisions regarding deficits, and to make legislative decision-making more efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\nCongress quickly expanded on the types of measures that could be considered under reconciliation until 1985 and 1986, when the Senate passed rules proposed by Sen. Robert Byrd that limited what could or could not be included when using this process.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore moving forward, Democrats must consider two questions. The first is whether using reconciliation to pass health care is legitimate or an abuse of the process. Republicans have charged that this would be akin to forcing the program through the chamber rather than passing the bill through negotiation and compromise.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn this question, the answer is easy. Reconciliation has been as much a part of the Senate in the past three decades as the filibuster. According to an article that was published in The New Republic, Congress passed 22 reconciliation bills between 1980 and 2008. Many important policy changes were enacted through this process, including the Children's Health Insurance Program, COBRA (which allows people who switch jobs to keep their health care), student aid reform, expansions in Medicaid and several major tax cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR's Julie Rovner reported that most of the health care reforms enacted in the past two decades have gone through reconciliation. President Ronald Reagan was one of the first presidents to make aggressive use of reconciliation when he pushed through his economic program in 1981. Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker said then that speed had been essential because \"Every day that this is delayed makes it more difficult to pass. This is an extraordinary proposal, and these are extraordinary times.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush all used reconciliation as well. It is worth noting that these presidents, particularly George W. Bush, also made use of sweeping executive power to circumvent Congress altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second question is more difficult and it involves perceptions. If the Democratic leadership wants to use this tactic, they have to convince enough members of their own party that this won't scare off independent voters. This argument was harder to make in 2009 than in 2010. But after a year of dealing with paralysis in the Senate and highly effective Republican obstruction, more Democrats are coming on board.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leadership must be proactive in responding to the criticism about reconciliation. They will have to explain that reconciliation is a legitimate process by pointing to the history.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey will also have to connect the dots for voters frustrated with the ineffective government by explaining that the constant use of the filibuster has turned the Senate into a supermajority institution where both parties have found it extraordinarily difficult -- virtually impossible -- to pass major legislation.On this point, Republicans and Democrats actually agree.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, as Democrats make this decision, Kentucky Republican Senator Jim Bunning is objecting to a unanimous consent order and single-handedly preventing the Senate from passing an important bill to assist unemployed workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats must also convince hesitant colleagues that the payoff could be greater than the cost. While, in the short-term, Republicans will complain that their opponents have rammed through social policy in some sort of unnatural procedural move, Democrats are facing these kinds of intense attacks anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\nRight now, Democrats are receiving the brunt of Republican attacks without being able to pass much legislation. If they pass health care, they will be able to respond to the arguments of the GOP, not just by complaining that Republicans obstruct everything, but by pointing to specific benefits such as lowering premiums by expanding how many people purchase coverage and bringing tens of millions of Americans into the health care system.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn certain respects, the White House made the use of reconciliation more difficult by initially accepting the notion that 60 votes were needed to pass legislation through the Senate. After the election of Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, a decision to refocus on procedures that only depend on 51 votes makes it more vulnerable to the attacks of manipulating the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in other respects, the administration now has a better political opportunity to use reconciliation. After a year, the public has seen just how dysfunctional Senate procedures can be in an era when filibusters are common.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a public that is frustrated by Washington, as the polls show, the Democrats might be able to persuade a sufficient number of their colleagues to go along. If they don't, one thing is for certain: Democrats will go into election day facing voters who are hearing all the complaints about their party but seeing very little in terms of what they can deliver on health care.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E.

He did not attend the week-long conference in Dharamsala, a town in the hills of north India where he lives in exile. He called the meeting, he said, to offer the exiles an opportunity to discuss \"the best possible future course of action\" for Tibet.\n\n\n\nTakhla said the Tibetans demonstrated that the Dalai Lama was their undisputed leader, and they hoped China would recognize him as such and negotiations toward a realistic solution could be held.\n\n\n\nThere was a small minority who said they wanted to demand Tibet's independence, Takhla said.\n\n\n\nThe \"middle way\" approach with Beijing is one in which Tibetans want a level of autonomy that will allow them to protect and preserve their culture, religion and national identity.

A Bhutto spokesman says the opposition leader was rushed away from the scene and was safe.\n\n\n\nFormer Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto arrives at a campaign rally Thursday in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Pakistan's Geo Television Network, quoting Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, reports the ex-premier was critically wounded in the bombing.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Former Pakistani government spokesman Tariq Azim Khan says Bhutto was hurt leaving the rally, but there is no indication whether she was shot or hurt in the bombing. Reports from police and the Bhutto camp conflict over whether she was injured.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Geo TV quotes Zardari saying his wife suffered a bullet wound to the neck after the suicide bombing.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Khan and Pakistan's primary television networks report Bhutto is dead. Television reports indicate she died of bullet wounds suffered after the suicide bombing.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Khan says it appears Bhutto was shot, but he adds it's unclear whether bullets or shrapnel caused her wounds.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Doctors and a spokesman for Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party confirm the ex-premier's death, but it remains unclear how she was killed.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Police tell CNN that a suicide bomber riding a motorcycle detonated himself near Bhutto's motorcade. She was rushed to nearby Rawalpindi General Hospital, where doctors pronounced her dead. Khan says it's unclear if a bullet or shrapnel dealt the fatal wounds.\n\n\n\nFriday morning, Pakistan time:\n\n\n\n\u2022 The Pakistani Interior Ministry tells the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan that Bhutto died of a gunshot wound to the neck. The suicide bomber fired shots before blowing himself up, the ministry tells the news agency. A photographer for Getty Images confirms hearing three shots before the blast.\n\n\n\n\u2022 CNN quotes a witness who describes Bhutto's killer as a \"thin young man jumping toward the vehicle and opening fire.\"\n\n\n\nFriday evening, Pakistan time:\n\n\n\n\u2022 The Interior Ministry tells the Associated Press of Pakistan that flying shrapnel from a suicide bomb killed Bhutto. The bomber also shot at her with a pistol, the ministry tells the state-run news agency, but Bhutto suffered no injuries from bullets.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Interior Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Javed Iqbal Cheema, citing a medical report, says Bhutto was hit on the right side of her skull with shrapnel.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Another Associated Press of Pakistan report quotes Dr. Mussadiq Khan saying that Bhutto showed \"no signs of life\" on her arrival at Rawalpindi General Hospital and that she was pronounced dead about 40 minutes later.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Cheema says Bhutto died after fracturing her skull on a sunroof lever in her vehicle. Contrary to previous reports, she did not die from bullet or shrapnel wounds and nothing entered her head, the Interior Ministry spokesman said.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Cheema says that Bhutto \"fell down or perhaps ducked\" when gunshots rang out. She apparently hit her head on a lever, Cheema said, adding that it was stained with blood.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Khan, the doctor who treated Bhutto before she was declared dead, says the former prime minister had a \"big wound\" on the side of her head \"that usually occurs when something big, with a lot of speed, hits that area.\" E-mail to a friend", "qa": [{"question": "What reports say Friday?", "answers": ["Bhutto was hit on the right side of her skull with shrapnel.", "medical"]}, {"question": "What did reports early Friday say Bhutto died from?", "answers": ["bullet wounds", "of bullet wounds suffered after the suicide bombing.", "of bullet wounds", "of a gunshot wound to the neck."]}, {"question": "who died from a gunshot wound to the neck?", "answers": ["former Pakistani Prime Minister", "Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto", "Benazir Bhutto"]}, {"question": "Who says Bhutto died after hitting his head?", "answers": ["Khan,", "CNN.", "of bullet wounds", "fracturing her skull on a sunroof lever in her vehicle.", "Tariq Azim Khan", "Pakistani police", "Cheema", "she did not die from bullet or shrapnel wounds and nothing entered her", "is dead."]}, {"question": "What killed Bhutto?", "answers": ["unclear how she was", "\"big wound\" on the side of her head"]}, {"question": "What did reports later on Friday say Bhutto died from?", "answers": ["a suicide bomb", "the ex-premier was critically wounded in the bombing.", "also shot at her with a pistol,", "flying shrapnel", "a suicide bomb killed"]}, {"question": "who killed BHutto?", "answers": ["bomber also shot at her with a pistol,", "suicide bomber", "suicide bomb", "\"thin young man jumping toward the vehicle and opening fire.\""]}]}
{"text": "(CNN) -- The power of the Mexican military was on full display Tuesday in Ciudad Juarez, where police reported the third consecutive day without a drug slaying.\n\n\n\nA federal police officer guards a checkpoint earlier this month in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico\n\n\n\nTen drug-related killings in a single day were common before 9,500 army troops poured into the blood-soaked border town in the past few weeks, said Mauricio Mauricio, a spokesman for the Juarez municipal police.\n\n\n\n\"It's a much more secure city at this moment,\" he said. \"We haven't had murders with the same regularity and frequency as before.\"\n\n\n\nBut as President Obama's administration announced plans Tuesday to beef up U.S. security along its border with Mexico, there are questions about whether increased military and police efforts in both nations can yield long-term results.\n\n\n\nMexico has been spiraling into a deepening pit of violence, with 6,500 people killed in 2008 and the body count continuing apace this year. Most of that violence is occurring along the border, which worries Washington.\n\n\n\nMexican President Felipe Calderon and others have said recently that the United States must share responsibility because the demand for drugs and most of the weapons used by drug cartels comes from north of the border.\n\n\n\nThe drug war and security will be a major topic when U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits Mexico on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\n\nAndrew Selee, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Mexico Institute, called Obama's pledge on Tuesday to give $700 million in aid to Mexico and assign an additional 360 staff along the border a \"substantive commitment\" that shows the United States is serious about attacking the problem.\n\n\n\n\"It's an attempt to really put some substance behind the idea of shared responsibility,\" Selee said. \"They finally committed some of the resources they said they would to this.\"\n\n\n\nSuccess will depend on the follow-through, he said.\n\n\n\n\"Now is the hard part,\" he said. \"It's not easy to follow the money trail or stop the weapons or the criminal networks.\"\n\n\n\nOthers say the Obama plan falls short.\n\n\n\nLarry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington policy institute, calls it a \"militarized strategy\" that isn't oriented toward finding solutions based on economic development or social justice programs.\n\n\n\n\"This is a feel-good strategy that is meant to produce the illusion of concrete developments taking place when it's actually just really more of the same,\" Birns said. \"You're talking about a 2,000-mile border, so the odd 16 [agents] here or 12 there is not going to do the trick.\"\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Mexico's major military commitment is certainly showing short-term benefits.\n\n\n\nBefore the army arrived in Ciudad Juarez, there had been more than 400 drug killings this year, police spokesman Mauricio said. Since the army arrived, slayings have dropped 95 percent, he said.\n\n\n\nPeter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue policy institute, says Mexico's use of the army in Juarez -- and its evident success -- \"shows that Mexico is definitely not a failed state. Nobody is going to challenge the government for control of a certain area.\"\n\n\n\nSelee sees it as \"increased determination from the Mexican government to establish order.\"\n\n\n\nBut there are limitations to using the military in Mexico, Birns and Hakim said.\n\n\n\n\"There's bad blood that exists between local communities and the military,\" said Birns. \"The Mexican military has not fought a war for years. It's enemy has always been the local population.\"\n\n\n\nHakim noted the cost in money, and to the daily fabric of life.\n\n\n\n\"That's not a cheap way of keeping law and order,\" he said. \"It does a great deal of harm to civilian institutions. The military is not trained to respect human liberties and individual rights.\"\n\n\n\nIt's an ambivalence that many Mexicans feel: security versus liberties.\n\n\n\nPolls consistently show that security is the top concern among a vast majority of Mexicans. And for many Mexican citizens, the drug war can still hit close to home no matter how far away they live from the front lines.\n\n\n\nAdrian Jesus Garrido Gomez, a 30-year-old bank loan officer with a wife and two young sons, lives in Tabasco state in southern Mexico, far from the violence tearing up Juarez and other border cities.\n\n\n\n\"Tabasco has always been relatively safe,\" Garrido said by telephone Tuesday.\n\n\n\nHe said a childhood friend worked for 2\u00bd years in a high-paying white-collar job in Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas. When he got married recently, his wife had one request: Let's move back to Tabasco. They did, six months ago.\n\n\n\n\"For them, it (was) very insecure,\" Garrido said.\n\n\n\nReynosa was the site of a four-hour gun battle last month that left five drug traffickers dead and seven police wounded. People worldwide saw video of a television reporter sprawled on a bridge during that fight, trying to file an on-air report over the roar of gunfire.\n\n\n\nHakim says Mexican President Calderon's efforts to paint the United States as partially responsible for the violence is lost on some Mexicans.\n\n\n\n\"In the end,\" Hakim said, \"this is Mexico's problem as much as Mexico talks about a shared problem. The costs of not getting control of it will be paid by the Mexicans.\"", "qa": [{"question": "What is the top concern among most Mexicans?", "answers": ["drug killings", "security", "military"]}, {"question": "What did the police report?", "answers": ["the third consecutive day without a drug slaying.", "slaying.", "drug slaying.", "reported the third consecutive day without a drug slaying.", "third consecutive day without"]}, {"question": "What are the questions that remain?", "answers": ["results.", "whether increased military and police efforts in both nations can yield long-term results.", "whether increased military and police efforts in both nations can yield"]}, {"question": "What has been consistently shown to be a top concern?", "answers": ["The drug war and security will", "security", "security is the", "a major topic when U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits Mexico"]}, {"question": "What entity do Mexicans distrust?", "answers": ["\"There's bad blood that exists between local communities and the military,\" said Birns.", "security", "military,\""]}, {"question": "For how many days was there no drug slaying?", "answers": ["the third consecutive", "third consecutive"]}, {"question": "What is a top concern for Mexicans?", "answers": ["security"]}, {"question": "What did the police report was third straight day of?", "answers": ["without a drug slaying.", "drug slaying.", "consecutive", "without", "reported"]}]}
{"text": "New York (CNN) -- When Alec Baldwin closed out the Academy Awards on Sunday night by slapping director Kathryn Bigelow squarely on the backside, that pretty much said it all.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was Ladies' Night in a Boys' Town.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, the opening routine by Baldwin and Steve Martin was very funny; there was sincerity and genuine gratitude from many of the winners; despite weird digressions into arcane areas like sound recording, the program moved briskly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut did the orchestra need to follow Bigelow's win of her long-deserved best director prize, for \"The Hurt Locker,\" by playing the old Helen Reddy song \"I Am Woman\"?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Zoe Saldana and Carey Mulligan arrived on stage to present the Best Original Song award, did they have to be intro-ed with \"Thank Heaven For Little Girls\"?\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in addition to being groped by Baldwin, did Bigelow have to be so muscled-in-on by her fellow producers when she was picking up the best picture award for her film, \"The Hurt Locker\"?\n\n\n\n\n\n'The Hurt Locker' wins six Oscars\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe that wacky Elinor Burkett had a point: The producer of \"Music by Prudence\" -- which had just won the Oscar for best documentary short -- barreled on stage, saying \"Let the woman speak!\" and commandeering the mike from her director, Roger Ross Williams.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe provided a classic moment of Oscar craziness and the one instance of spontaneity in an evening when all the big favorites won all the big prizes. Burkett seemed boorish, sure. But that doesn't necessarily make her wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences certainly faced a dilemma this year: Vote for the future, or make up for the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nYears from now, it will probably look profoundly shortsighted that \"Avatar,\" one of the biggest movies ever -- and, more importantly, the one that indicates where movies are going -- didn't win the top prize when Hollywood had a chance to bestow it.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, the Oscars gave their most coveted awards to a small indie film about an unpopular war and a director whose sex had never before been honored with a best director prize.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat helped make it all so complicated was not that there's been a long, long history of overlooked genius female directors that the Oscars had to atone for.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sin at stake was -- and is -- that women simply have never been given an equal chance to direct.\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictably, Bigelow didn't have to be as good as the boys, she had to be better. And she was.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut earning your Oscars and actually getting them are two different things. Fortunately for Bigelow, she had history on her side last night.\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Cameron didn't.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe billions being made by \"Avatar\" will probably be some consolation, but neither he nor his movie are warm and fuzzy, which is what the Academy voters like.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the big-hearted, sentimental acceptance by best actor Jeff Bridges (\"Crazy Heart\"), and the rather elegant, funny remarks by best actress Sandra Bullock (\"The Blind Side\"), are exactly what we all want Oscar night to be.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat, and a few good jokes, which is what Martin and Baldwin provided, arriving on stage after a musical extravaganza starring Neil Patrick Harris that seemed ready to recall the bad old days of producer Alan Carr and the notorious Rob Lowe/Snow White musical overture of 1989.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking back on Oscar's 'train wreck'\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing so ghastly reared its ugly head last night, although there were a few moments of bad choices, bad manners and a strategy that was, at best, elusive.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all the changing characters and categories on Oscar-watchers' betting pool ballots, there are certain things we bet on no matter what: one, that the show will be interminable; two, that it will last at least until midnight (ET) no matter how they try to contain it; and, three, that there will be moments in the show itself that, although planned by seemingly sane individuals, will be inexplicable, if not grotesque.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast night did not disappoint. While someone like poor Tivi Magnusson got drowned out by the orchestra (after he and Joachim Back won best live action short for \"The New Tenants\"), the show's producers thought it made perfect sense to devote relatively huge chunks of time to examining the niceties of animated short subjects or providing weary viewers the inevitable, unspeakable interpretive dance number, this one devoted to the evening's musical scores.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore painful, at least to this viewer's eyes, was an overlong salute to the late director John Hughes, featuring a reunion of some of his more famous players, a few of whom -- Molly Ringwald, for instance, and Judd Nelson -- looked positively shell shocked.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only surprises of the night were in the best foreign film category: The Argentine \"El Secreto de Sus Ojos,\" beat out the favored \"White Ribbon,\" thus continuing the Oscar tradition of giving the foreign-film prize to something few have even seen (a foreign-film Oscar doesn't do much good, one should remember, for a movie that's already opened and closed).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other surprise was the rudeness with which costume designer Sandy Powell accepted her \"Young Victoria\" Oscar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've already got two of these,\" she said, before dissing her coworkers and, by extension, the Academy in toto.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrusque dismissal is not a quality Oscar tolerates very well and it's not likely Ms. Powell will be back, unlike Martin and Baldwin, who were the funniest Oscar hosts ever, proving there's power in numbers, the sum often can be more than the parts, and that it's always good to have an extra pair of hands, as long as they stay off Kathryn Bigelow's butt.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Anderson.", "qa": [{"question": "what was avatar nominated for", "answers": ["Academy", "Oscar"]}, {"question": "The critic said a salaute to which late director was long overdue", "answers": ["John Hughes,"]}, {"question": "what did the critic say", "answers": ["It was Ladies' Night in a Boys' Town."]}, {"question": "Who is John Hughes?", "answers": ["late director", "director"]}, {"question": "Who were the funniest Oscar hosts, according to a critic?", "answers": ["Martin and Baldwin,", "Martin", "Baldwin,"]}, {"question": "What has Oscar had to atone for?", "answers": ["overlooked genius female directors", "long history of overlooked genius female directors", "long history of overlooked genius female directors that the"]}, {"question": "Which two people were said to be the funniest hosts ever", "answers": ["Martin", "Baldwin,"]}, {"question": "John Anderson said the Oscar's had to atone for what", "answers": ["overlooked genius female directors", "long history of overlooked genius female directors"]}]}

{"text": "PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN) -- It was supposed to be just another day at work.\n\nJob losses suffered by Linda and Chris Metzger have had a ripple effect on other businesses in their community\n\nIn early March 2008, 31-year-old Linda Metzger went to the New York office where she had worked as an assistant vice president in the marketing department at Lehman Brothers for about a year. Only 15 minutes into her work day, Metzger was called into her manager's office, where a representative from human resources was waiting.\n\n\"They told me that the company was having economic difficulties and that they had to make budget cuts,\" Metzger said. \"They were afraid that they were going to have to let me go and that it was not due to performance.\"\n\nMetzger says that would be her last day at Lehman Brothers. She was given some time to collect her composure, gather her belongings and head home.\n\nShe was out of a $90,000-a-year job and was getting married in three months. Metzger says it was a chance for her and her fianc\u00c3\u00a9 to refocus, relocate and start a new life.\n\nWithin a few weeks, they both found jobs near Phoenix, Arizona, earning close to what they were making in New York. They bought a home and two new cars and got married.\n\nBut the good feelings suddenly and dramatically ended in October when Metzger, who was four months pregnant, showed up to work at Lumension, where she was a marketing manager.\n\nMetzger says she was called into the office, and it happened again. She was laid off from her second job in less than a year.  Watch Linda talk about getting laid off \u00c2\u00bb\n\n\"I was so overwhelmed and so shocked that I just immediately burst into tears.\"\n\nShe thought about how she and her new husband, who had just moved across the country, were going to be able to afford their new life and all the bills that came with it.\n\nA week later, Chris Metzger was called into his manager's office at the job placement agency where he worked. He was told that because of the economy, his office was closing, and he was out of a job. Now he had to break the news to his wife.\n\n\"I just came home, and she was upstairs,\" Chris Metzger said. He tried to find the best way to tell his wife that they no longer had an income. \"I walked upstairs, I gave her a hug, and I said, 'I lost my job today.' \"\n\n\"I immediately fell to the floor and just started crying,\" Linda said.\n\nWithin 10 days, Chris was able to find a new job, but Linda had no such luck. The economy was taking its toll, and very few companies were hiring. They looked at their budget and started to eliminate all the extras, including dining out and gym memberships. Vacations were put on hold; furniture purchases had to wait; fine meals out were now home-cooked meals.\n\nThe Metzgers' story is playing out all across America as businesses and communities feel the ripple effect of the recession\n\n\"When jobs get lost, demand falls for a whole bunch of businesses. You're not going to buy new shoes; you're going to put new soles on them,\" said Lakshman Achuthan, managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, an independent group that studies recessions.\n\nRestaurants where the Metzgers used to dine are now closed.

{"text": "Editor's note: Leslie Morgan Steiner is the author of \"Crazy Love,\" a new memoir about domestic violence, and the anthology \"Mommy Wars,\" which explores the polarization between stay-at-home and career moms.\n\nLeslie Morgan Steiner says domestic violence afflicts the well-to-do as well as the poor.\n\n(CNN) -- For two days, news reports called her \"the 20-year old victim\" allegedly attacked by R&B singer and dancer Chris Brown in his car early February 8 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nWe all now have good reason to believe that the alleged victim was pop singer Rihanna, Brown's girlfriend.\n\nThe story has dominated the general media with good reason. Both singers are young, apple-cheek gorgeous, immensely talented and squeaky clean -- the last couple you'd imagine as domestic violence headliners.\n\nPerhaps the only good that will come from the Rihanna/Brown publicity is destruction of our culture's misconception that abusers and their victims can only be universally poor, uneducated and powerless.\n\nBrown, whose first song debuted at No. 1 and whose first album topped the Billboard Hot 100, appeared on a Disney sitcom and in Sesame Street, Got Milk? and Wrigley's Doublemint Gum commercials. Barbados-born Rihanna has been big-brothered by music industry legends like Jay-Z and Kanye West and is signed to the Def Jam Recordings label.\n\nShe has been astonishingly successful in the short time she has been on the music scene, attaining five Billboard Hot 100 No. 1's with \"SOS,\" \"Umbrella,\" \"Take a Bow,\" \"Disturbia\" and T.I.'s \"Live Your Life.\"\n\nLike Rihanna, I had a bright future in my early 20s. I met my abusive lover at 22. I'd just graduated from Harvard and had a job at Seventeen Magazine in New York.\n\nMy husband worked on Wall Street and was an Ivy League graduate as well. In our world, we were the last couple you'd imagine enmeshed in domestic violence.\n\nMany of my ex-husband's attacks also took place in our car. For reasons I never understood, the enclosed, soundproof space brought out his worst violence. He punched me so fiercely that my face had bruises from his fist on one side and from hitting the window on the other.\n\nAs trapped in the car as I was in our marriage, it was there that I endured tirades about how controlling I was with money, how flirtatious and na\u00efve I was with other men, how defiant and disrespectful I was of my husband's authority.\n\nSo, I suppose I have more understanding than most about the shame, fury, confusion and disappointment Rihanna may be experiencing. What's hardest for outsiders to fathom is how lethal a cocktail love, hope and sympathy can be. I first fell for my husband the night he confided how he, like Chris Brown, had been traumatized as a young boy by domestic violence in his home.\n\n\"He used to hit my mom ... He made me terrified all the time, terrified like I had to pee on myself,\" Brown said during a 2007 interview with Giant magazine.\n\nBrown hasn't explained what happened in the recent incident, but this week he released a statement saying that he's sorry and saddened by it.\n\nOur culture encourages women to nurture men, making it predictable that many experience a seductive empathy for abusive men, as well as the misguided hope that love can obliterate an ugly past.\n\nIn my case, it took four years, myriad terrifying attacks, and the intervention of the police and family court before I understood how little I could help my ex get over his abusive childhood.\n\nI certainly felt alone during my abusive relationship, but unfortunately I was in good company. The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that between 1 million and 3 million women in America are physically abused by their husband or boyfriend each year.\n\nEvery day, on average, three women are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends. At some point in our lives, 25 percent of American women will report being physically abused or raped by intimate partners, according to the National Violence Against Women Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHowever, these statistics, grim as they are, fail to highlight the root of the abuse cycle. A national survey showed that 50 percent of men who frequently assault their wives also frequently abuse their children.\n\nWitnessing abuse, as Chris Brown and my ex-husband did as young boys, is a form of abuse itself. Tragically, many victims of childhood abuse grow up to be abusers themselves. I always sensed that my husband didn't want to be hurting me -- he knew exactly how excruciating love and fear felt mixed together -- but his childhood rage overpowered his adult sensibilities.\n\nA few months after I left my marriage, I happened across another couple in another car, late at night on an empty street. I slowed down as a well-dressed woman about 25 years old was walking away from a white Honda, brushing off a tall, handsome young man wearing a sports coat and jeans.\n\nSuddenly she turned and tried to run. He grabbed her with his long arms and shoved her up against a dirty storefront. Even from my car I could see the fear on her pretty face.\n\nWithout thinking, I jerked my car over and got out. By this time the man had let the woman go and she'd slid behind the wheel of the car. He stepped back as I approached, his anger displaced by uncertainty and shame at being interrupted. I didn't look at him. I leaned into the car as she sat clutching the wheel, crying and staring straight ahead.\n\n\"I just left a husband who beat me for three years,\" I said. \"You do not have to put up with this. You do not deserve to be treated like this.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she whispered as fresh tears poured down her face. She sniffed loudly and shook her head. She wouldn't look at me. Her eyes were rimmed red, but I could see resolve in them.\n\n\"You're right,\" she said. \"It's just taking me longer than I thought.\"\n\nAs I left, I gave the man a long stare. The spell had been broken and his face was open, sorrowful, filled with hope and fear -- a look I had seen dozens of times on my husband's face. How long would that look last before he got angry again? I could feel the woman's determination as I got back into my car. I knew she would be all right, one day. The man, I was less certain about.\n\nFamily violence is a criminal act; perpetrators, while often former victims themselves, need to accept culpability. Until we can prevent children from witnessing and becoming victims of abuse, the cycle will repeat itself: there will be many more Chris Browns and \"alleged victims\" in our headlines and in our homes.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leslie Morgan Steiner.", "qa": [{"question": "What can be done to protect children?", "answers": ["prevent", "from witnessing and becoming victims"]}, {"question": "What are the causes of abuse?", "answers": ["Witnessing"]}, {"question": "what does  Exposing children to such violence do?", "answers": ["victims of childhood abuse grow up", "afflicts the well-to-do as well as the poor.", "be abusers themselves.", "the cycle will repeat itself:"]}, {"question": "what was Leslie Steiner?", "answers": ["Morgan", "I", "in good company.", "author", "is"]}, {"question": "What studies showcase this subject?", "answers": ["National Violence Against Women Survey", "National Violence Against Women Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."]}, {"question": "Who is Leslie Steiner?", "answers": ["author of \"Crazy Love,\""]}, {"question": "what does Leslie Steiner say?", "answers": ["domestic violence afflicts the well-to-do as well as the poor."]}]}
{"text": "(EW.com) -- Although it didn't set a franchise record, \"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 1\" had one of the best openings in box-office history by debuting to $139.5 million, according to studio estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's the fifth-best opening weekend ever, behind \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2,\" \"The Dark Knight,\" \"Spider-Man 3,\" and \"The Twilight Saga: New Moon,\" which held on to the franchise record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"New Moon\" debuted to a slightly better $142.8 million on the same November weekend two years ago. What's interesting is how closely \"Breaking Dawn\" followed \"New Moon's\" trajectory. \"New Moon\" grossed $72.7 million its first day, and then dropped 42 percent on Saturday and 34 percent on Sunday. By comparison, \"Breaking Dawn\" earned $72 million on Friday (the third-best opening day ever), and then fell 44 percent on Saturday and a projected 34 percent today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"New Moon\" ultimately finished its domestic run with $296.6 million, and it's too early to tell whether \"Breaking Dawn\" will wind up a bit short of that final figure. Even if it does, Summit Entertainment won't be complaining about grossing nearly $300 million from the fourth movie of its franchise. And, of course, the domestic box office is only a part of the equation here. \"Breaking Dawn\" took in $144 million from 54 foreign territories this week, pushing its worldwide debut to a staggering $283.5 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummit reports that \"Breaking Dawn\" attracted a crowd that was, unsurprisingly, 80 percent female. What is surprising is that the PG-13 movie's audience wasn't as young as you'd think, with 60 percent over the age of 21. According to CinemaScore, 30 percent of the film's audience was under 18, but an even larger 42 percent was between the ages of 18 and 34. The popular conception is that The \"Twilight Saga\" is merely a teenage phenomenon, but these figures seem to prove otherwise. The $110 million movie received a good-but-not-great B+ rating from CinemaScore graders.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn second place was Warner Bros.' 3-D animated sequel \"Happy Feet Two,\" which fell far short of expectations by dancing to only $22 million. The 2006 original, an Oscar winner for best animated feature, opened to $41.5 million -- and that was without the benefit of 3-D surcharges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Happy Feet Two\" was saddled with mediocre reviews, which might have discouraged some parents. Furthermore, five years could have been too long of a wait, especially for a sequel that appeared very similar to its predecessor. The original \"Happy Feet\" was released a year after March of the Penguins, when the Antarctic birds were having a moment in the cultural zeitgeist. That moment has clearly passed. The $135 million sequel earned a B+ rating from CinemaScore moviegoers, and 3-D theaters accounted for 50 percent of its weekend tally.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of the top five consisted of holdovers. The 3-D action flick \"Immortals\" dropped a harsh 62 percent for $12.3 million -- a second-weekend decline that was larger than both \"300\" (54 percent) and \"Clash of the Titans\" (57 percent). \"Jack and Jill\" witnessed a typical Adam Sandler fall of 52 percent for $12 million. And even though \"Happy Feet Two\" underperformed, \"Puss in Boots\" lost much of its family audience. The animated adventure dropped 57 percent for $10.7 million in its fourth weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn limited release, Alexander Payne's \"The Descendants,\" starring George Clooney, debuted to $1.2 million from 29 theaters -- enough for a tenth-place finish. The Oscar hopeful raked in an impressive $42,150 per location. Only \"Midnight in Paris,\" \"The Tree of Life,\" and \"Jane Eyre\" opened to stronger per-theater averages this year, and those movies started out on far fewer screens than \"The Descendants.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

The Web site said the letter was posted after Rafsanjani failed to respond.\n\n\n\nThe treatment of detainees at Iran's prisons has increasingly become a high profile issue, with human-rights groups accusing guards of conducting harsh interrogations, beatings, sleep deprivation, and threats of torture to coerce false confessions.\n\n\n\nIranian media reported that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, ordered one prison, Kahrizak, shut down amid reports it did not measure up to the required standards. Kahrizak's chief was fired and arrested over allegations of detainee mistreatment, according to local reports Saturday.\n\n\n\nA special parliamentary committee has made rounds at Tehran's Evin prison, but did not find any signs of abuse, according to recent media reports. Hundreds of detainees have since been reportedly released from Evin, though \"political figures\" were held and put on trial.\n\n\n\nIn his plea for an investigation, Karrubi says he has heard descriptions of torture and violence that make his \"body shake,\" though he doesn't specify a prison.\n\n\n\n\"Some of the former detainees have told of such brutal and violent, repeated rapes of the young women [in detention] that have caused irreparable damage to their reproductive systems,\" Karrubi says in the letter. \"Others have raped our detained young men with such brutality that they [the victims] have been afflicted by depression and are no longer speaking with anyone and refuse to leave the dark corners of their houses.\"\n\n\n\nHe adds that an investigation will \"teach a lesson to the thugs and criminals in the future and prevent the smearing of the reputation of the Islamic Republic.\"\n\n\n\nRafsanjani -- a former president and head of the Assembly of Experts, the council responsible for appointing or removing the supreme leader -- called for the release of the detainees during a highly anticipated July 17 sermon at Friday prayers.\n\n\n\nHe backed Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi in the presidential election, in which hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming winner. Karrubi and Moussavi unsuccessfully challenged the results for weeks, and Ahmadinejad was sworn in for his second term last week.\n\n\n\nRafsanjani himself has been accused of helping fuel the post-election unrest as part of recent mass trials of the remaining detainees over the past week.", "qa": [{"question": "What does Karrubi claim happened to both men and women?", "answers": ["violent, repeated rapes", "rapes", "mistreatment", "brutal"]}, {"question": "In what elction was Mehdi Karrubi a candidate?", "answers": ["presidential election,", "Iranian", "former Iranian presidential"]}, {"question": "Who called for investigation into the letter?", "answers": ["Mehdi Karrubi"]}, {"question": "What is he willing to do?", "answers": ["lead the investigation in a \"truthful, unbiased fashion.\""]}, {"question": "What was called for by him?", "answers": ["of the disputed", "presidential elections.", "the release of the detainees during a highly anticipated July 17 sermon at Friday prayers.", "former", "A", "Iranian presidential candidate is calling on one of the Islamic republic's", "most powerful clerics to approve a special committee to investigate alleged mistreatment of detainees arrested in the aftermath"]}, {"question": "What is Karrubi looking to investigate?", "answers": ["mistreatment of detainees.", "alleged mistreatment of detainees.", "alleged mistreatment of detainees arrested in the aftermath of the disputed presidential elections."]}, {"question": "What are some of the claims he's making?", "answers": ["alleged mistreatment of detainees arrested in the aftermath of the disputed presidential elections.", "detainee mistreatment,"]}, {"question": "What was he a candidate for?", "answers": ["approve a special committee to investigate alleged mistreatment of detainees", "Iranian presidential"]}]}

I always have such great respect for someone who goes to Broadway and then film and goes back again. I saw her in \"The Philadelphia Story\" years ago in London when she won an award. She was very young in a musical version of that.\n\nKing: What was your read on them as a couple that day?\n\nRivers: Totally happy, totally devoted to each other. That's what kills me. I mean [it] just shouldn't have happened. ... And they made such a good-looking couple, too. He doted on what she said, she doted on -- it was just perfect.\n\nKing: How did you learn of this yesterday?\n\nRivers: One of our mutual friends called me and said, do you know about -- I just saw them recently in the thing that Prince Charles gave in England, and a mutual friend said, did you heard about what happened to Natasha? I said, what are you talking about? And he said, she's brain-dead.  Watch King talk to celebrities about Richardson \u00bb\n\nKing: So you knew yesterday?\n\nRivers: I knew yesterday. And I knew yesterday that she was brain-dead. And I was told, which is, again, so dear, that they kept her alive purposely to bring her back to New York, so that the boys could say goodbye to her before --\n\nKing: Really?\n\nRivers: Yes.\n\nKing: That's both beautiful and sad.\n\nRivers: Look at this, it gets me crazy. It's sad.\n\nKing: Do you ski?\n\nRivers: I had a terrible fall about 12 years ago. And I lay there in the snow and I said to myself, \"If I get up, I'm not coming back and I got up.\"\n\nKing: You're like, \"Goodbye.\"\n\nRivers: Goodbye. And I swear to you, I laid on the ground and I go, \"If everything works, that's it. That's it.\"\n\nKing: You've heard the doctor. What do you make of this? There must have been something previously. It was a slight fall?\n\nRivers: You don't know; you hit your head wrong. You walk out of your house and it's over. We all know that, especially at this age. You understand that it's over, it's gone. It's just not that [Richardson's] age, not with a good marriage, not with two young boys. It shouldn't be.\n\nKing: John Kennedy said life isn't fair.\n\nRivers: It isn't. It isn't.

{"text": "(CNN) -- German car manufacturer BMW has announced it is to pull out of Formula One at the end of the current season after a \"landmark\" decision to restructure the group's motorsport activities was made by the company's board in a meeting on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nBMW Sauber have opted to pull out Formula One at the end of the 2009 season.\n\n\n\nA statement on the BMW Sauber F1 Team's official Web site stated that \"the Formula One campaign is [no longer] a key promoter for us\" and that \"current developments in motor sport\" had resulted in the decision.\n\n\n\nDr Norbert Reithofer, chairman of the BMW board of management, said: \"Of course, this was a very difficult decision for us. But it's a resolute step in view of our company's strategic realignment.\"\n\n\n\nThe team currently lie eighth in the constructors' world championship with eight points after 10 rounds and of their two drivers -- Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld -- Heidfeld sits a lowly 13th in the drivers' championship with just six points.\n\n\n\nBMW are the second manufacturer to pull out of F1 in a further blow to the sport after Honda's withdrawal before the start of the 2009 season.  CNN's analysis of BMW's exit from Formula One. \u00bb\n\n\n\nHowever, since Wednesday's announcement, rival German car manufacturer Mercedes have reconfirmed their commitment to the sport.\n\n\n\n\"We regret the withdrawal of BMW from Formula One. This decision will not have the slightest influence on our commitment to Formula One,\" a spokesman for the company told AFP.\n\n\n\nMotorsport's world governing body, the FIA, reiterated their belief that the move was an indication of how the global economic downturn was affecting the sport.\n\n\n\nIn a statement on their official Web site, they said: \"The FIA regrets the announcement of BMW's intended withdrawal from Formula One but is not surprised by it. It has been clear for some time that motor sport cannot ignore the world economic crisis.\n\n\n\n\"Car manufacturers cannot be expected to continue to pour large sums of money into Formula One when their survival depends on redundancies, plant closures and the support of the taxpayer. This is why the FIA prepared regulations to reduce costs drastically.\n\n\n\n\"These measures were needed to alleviate the pressure on manufacturers following Honda's withdrawal but also to make it possible for new teams to enter. Had these regulations not been so strongly opposed by a number of team principals, the withdrawal of BMW and further such announcements in the future might have been avoided,\" the statement added.\n\n\n\nBMW entered Formula One with a takeover of the Sauber F1 team in 2005 and finished fifth in the constructors' championship in their debut campaign, before racing under their own name in 2006.\n\n\n\nWith an aggressive aim of winning the world championship within three years, the team came close in 2007 finishing second to Ferrari, thanks largely to the exclusion of McLaren-Mercedes from the manufacturer's points standings. In 2008, the team captured third, thanks in part to a first win in the Canadian Grand Prix for Polish driver Kubica.\n\n\n\nThe statement continued: \"It only took us three years to establish ourselves as a top team with the BMW Sauber F1 team. Unfortunately, the team were unable to meet expectations in the current season.\"\n\n\n\nThe car-builder was also unable to \"quantify redundancies\" that may come from the move which follows the exit of  Honda in December.\n\n\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer -- who according to FIA president Max Mosley were spending $500m a season to compete in the sport -- cited the \"sudden contraction of the world economies\" as their reason to end racing.\n\n\n\nThis led to Mosley spearheading an FIA plan to enforce controversial cost-cutting measures on the teams for the 2010 season. The Formula One furor explained.\n\n\n\nThese measures, which split opinion within the sport, are expected to be adopted in a watered-down form and could eventually save $60 million from the cost of running a team, according to Mosley.\n\n\n\nHowever, the FIA were prompted by BMW's exit to warn again that if the measures were weakened too much the positive impact on the sport could be reduced.\n\n\n\n\"As a result of a sustained cost-cutting campaign by the FIA, new measures are in the process of being agreed which should make it easier for new teams to enter and enable existing ones to participate on much reduced budgets.\n\n\n\n\"It is no secret that these measures do not go as far as the FIA would have liked but a compromise was needed in the interests of harmony in the sport. Hopefully it will be enough to prevent further withdrawals and provide a solid foundation for Formula One,\" the statement read.", "qa": [{"question": "In what year did BMW enter the sport?", "answers": ["2006.", "2005"]}, {"question": "What reason does BMW give for leaving?", "answers": ["\"the Formula One campaign is [no longer] a key promoter", "us\""]}, {"question": "what did BMW announce?", "answers": ["pull out of Formula One at the end of the", "current", "it is to pull out of Formula One at the end of the", "current season"]}, {"question": "When did BMW enter Formula One?", "answers": ["in 2005", "2006.", "entered", "2005"]}, {"question": "What does BMW announce?", "answers": ["it is to pull out of Formula One at the end of the", "Sauber have opted to pull out Formula One", "has announced it is to pull out of Formula One", "pull out of Formula One", "current season"]}, {"question": "What is the current position of the F1 team?", "answers": ["\"current developments in motor sport\"", "Formula One campaign is [no longer]", "company's strategic realignment.\"", "key promoter for us\""]}, {"question": "When is BMW leaving Formula One", "answers": ["at the end of the 2009 season.", "at the end of the", "the end of the", "current season"]}, {"question": "what is the current porpuse of German motor manufacturer?", "answers": ["pull out of Formula One at the end of the", "restructure the group's motorsport activities", "decision", "season"]}]}

{"text": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's family and about 200 of their closest friends gathered on a hill Thursday evening for their final farewell to the pop singer, who died 10 weeks ago.\n\n\n\nThursday's service for singer Michael Jackson began 90 minutes past the announced start time.\n\n\n\nJackson's burial may lay to rest some of the mystery and controversy that erupted with his sudden death on June 25.\n\n\n\nHis large family was divided over where the superstar's final resting place should be, but matriarch Katherine Jackson settled on a crypt inside the well-guarded and ornate Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, California.\n\n\n\nThursday's service began 90 minutes past the announced start time, leaving dozens of celebrities -- including Elizabeth Taylor -- waiting in their seats for the 26 cars carrying the Jackson clan to arrive.  Gallery: Invitation for Jackson's service \u00bb\n\n\n\nIt began with Jackson's five brothers -- each wearing a single sequined glove -- carrying his flower-covered bronze casket onto the outdoor stage among six large bouquets of white lilies and white roses, along with green topiaries.\n\n\n\nHis three children, led by daughter, Paris, 11, placed a crown atop their father's coffin, which a family spokesman said it was \"to signify the final resting place of the King of Pop.\"\n\n\n\nJackson's children, parents and siblings took their seats in the front row, while his nieces and nephews filled several rows of white chairs behind them.\n\n\n\nAfter an opening prayer by Pastor Lucius Smith, soul music legend Gladys Knight sang the gospel hymn \"His Eye Is on the Sparrow.\"\n\n\n\nClifton Davis sang \"Never Can Say Goodbye,\" a hit he wrote for The Jackson 5 -- the group that featured a young Michael and his brothers.\n\n\n\nWhat was said by Jackson's father, Joe Jackson, and others who took the lectern is not publicly known, because the family barred news cameras from the ceremony. A family statement issued afterward said close friends and family, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, spoke \"spontaneously to celebrate Michael's life.\"\n\n\n\nNews helicopters hovering above captured video from a distance, but without sound.  Watch media cover Jackson funeral \u00bb\n\n\n\nLisa Marie Presley, one of Jackson's former wives and the daughter of Elvis, attended the service, according to the family statement. It did not mention Debbie Rowe, Jackson's second wife and the mother of his two oldest children.\n\n\n\nMacaulay Culkin, the \"Home Alone\" actor who spent time with Jackson during his Neverland Ranch days, was there with his girlfriend, actress Mila Kunis.\n\n\n\nActors Corey Feldman and Chris Tucker were also seen arriving for the service.\n\n\n\nMotown founder Berry Gordy, who gave Jackson and his brothers their first big record deal, and Quincy Jones, who produced Jackson's \"Thriller\" album, were there. Music producer Teddy Riley, who helped with Jackson's 1991 \"Dangerous\" album, attended.\n\n\n\nThe guest list included TV executive Suzanne de Passe, who produced a miniseries about Jackson's family, and Kenny Ortega,  who was producing Jackson's comeback show.\n\n\n\nThomas Mesereau, the lawyer who successfully defended Jackson in a child molestation trial, sat just behind the Jackson family.\n\n\n\nWhen the hour-long service ended, his brothers lifted Jackson's casket for a final time to carry him inside the Great Mausoleum, where he was placed in his crypt at 9:43 p.m. PT (12:43 a.m. ET Friday).\n\n\n\nThe family statement said it was \"his final resting place.\"\n\n\n\nThe family and friends then drove to an Italian restaurant eight miles away, in Pasadena, California, for \"a time of celebration.\"\n\n\n\nThe massive mausoleum, the final resting place for Clark Gable, Carole Lombard and dozens of other celebrities, is normally open to tourists, though the public is denied close access to crypts. Security guards, aided by cameras, keep constant vigil over the graves and crypts, which are surrounded by a world-class collection of art and architecture.\n\n\n\nThe Forest Lawn Web site boasts that the mausoleum, which draws its architectural inspiration from the Campo Santo in Italy, \"has been called the 'New World's Westminster Abbey' by Time Magazine.\"\n\n\n\nVisitors will see \"exact replicas of Michelangelo's greatest works such as David, Moses, and La Pieta\" and \"Leonardo da Vinci's immortal Last Supper re-created in brilliant stained glass; two of the world's largest paintings,\" the Web site says.\n\n\n\nJackson's burial was delayed by division among family members, though Katherine Jackson would make the final decision, brother Jermaine Jackson recently told CNN.\n\n\n\nHe preferred to see his youngest brother laid to rest at his former Neverland Ranch home, north of Los Angeles in Santa Barbara County, California.\n\n\n\nThat idea was complicated by neighbors who vowed to oppose allowing a grave in the rural area -- and by Jackson family members who said the singer would not want to return to the home where he faced child molestation charges, of which he was ultimately acquitted.\n\n\n\nThe mystery of where Jackson would be buried became a media obsession in the weeks after his death.\n\n\n\nAfter his body was loaded onto a helicopter at UCLA's Ronald Reagan Medical Center hours after his June 25 death, it stayed in the custody of the Los Angeles County coroner for an autopsy.\n\n\n\nIt was only later disclosed that Jackson's corpse was kept in a refrigerated room at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn cemetery until his casket was carried by motorcade to downtown Los Angeles for a public memorial service in the Staples Center arena.\n\n\n\nAgain, speculation about Jackson's whereabouts grew when the media lost track of his casket after his brothers carried it out of sight inside the arena. It was only recently confirmed that it was taken back to the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn while awaiting his family's decision.\n\n\n\nThough Thursday's interment may settle one Jackson mystery, a more serious one remains. The coroner announced last week that he had ruled Jackson's death a homicide. A summary of the coroner's report said the anesthetic propofol and the sedative lorazepam were the primary drugs responsible for the singer's death.\n\n\n\nLos Angeles police detectives have not concluded their criminal investigation and no one has been charged.", "qa": [{"question": "What famous guests were there?", "answers": ["Clifton Davis", "Quincy Jones,", "list included", "Kenny Ortega,", "Michael Jackson's family", "Teddy Riley,", "Lisa Marie Presley,", "Berry Gordy,", "Suzanne de Passe,", "Mila Kunis.", "Actors Corey Feldman and Chris Tucker", "Pastor Lucius Smith,", "Macaulay Culkin,", "Thomas Mesereau,", "Gladys Knight"]}, {"question": "Who sang Never Can Say Goodbye?", "answers": ["Clifton Davis"]}, {"question": "what other important guest were included at the funeral?", "answers": ["Kenny Ortega,", "Suzanne de Passe,", "TV executive Suzanne de Passe,"]}, {"question": "Who were amongst the guests?", "answers": ["Rev.

{"text": "COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN)  -- Democratic Sen. Barack Obama kicked off a series of local outreach gospel concerts Friday in Charleston, South Carolina, that unexpectedly came back to bite his campaign.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama is competing for the black vote with Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe concerts were meant to boost black voters' support for his presidential nominee bid -- the kind of events that would normally fly under the national radar.\n\nThe ensuing controversy highlighted that Obama's desire to unite disparate voting blocs -- especially religious voters -- under his umbrella of \"change\" is not without some serious pitfalls.\n\nWhen the campaign announced the lineups for the three-city \"Embrace the Change!\" gospel tour last week, one name stood out to gay bloggers: Donnie McClurkin.\n\nThe Grammy-award winning singer is on record as saying homosexuality is a choice, and that he was \"once involved with those desires and those thoughts\" but was able to get past them through prayer.\n\nTo say the least, neither of those arguments is very popular in the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.\n\nJohn Aravosis, a prominent gay blogger and co-founder of the Web site AmericaBlog, led the charge against the Obama campaign, writing that the Illinois Democrat was \"sucking up to anti-gay bigots\" and \"giving them a stage.\"\n\nWhen the story bubbled up into the mainstream media, it took the Obama campaign by surprise.\n\nObama's efforts in the Palmetto State have overwhelmingly targeted African-American churchgoers in a bid to win over black voters in South Carolina from rival Sen. Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe campaign has vigorously promoted the candidate's faith, launching \"40 Days of Faith and Family\" in September, which used Bible study groups to tap into the black electorate.\n\nCampaigners have run three radio ads, one of which called Obama a \"Christian family man,\" that aired on gospel stations across the state.\n\nEarlier this month, Obama spoke at an evangelical church in the traditionally conservative city of Greenville, where he demonstrated a casual familiarity with Christian vocabulary, telling the crowd, to much applause, that \"I am confident that we can create a kingdom right here on Earth.\"\n\nAfter that appearance, the Obama campaign told CNN that Republicans no longer had a choke hold on issues of faith and values.\n\n\"I think that what you're seeing is a breaking down of the sharp divisions that existed maybe during the '90s,\" Obama said. \"At least in politics, the perception was that the Democrats were fearful of talking about faith, and on the other hand you had the Republicans who had a particular brand of faith that oftentimes seemed intolerant or pushed people away.\"\n\nBut on Tuesday, Obama was forced to confront the uncomfortable truth that some Christians and gays are a little more than just strange bedfellows, especially among blacks.\n\nObama issued a statement saying, \"I strongly disagree with Reverend [Donnie] McClurkin's views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the United States,\" and argued that it is important to confront homophobia among religious African Americans.\n\nA September poll of African Americans in South Carolina by Winthrop University and ETV showed that 62 percent of those surveyed said that \"sex between two adults of the same sex\" is \"strongly unacceptable.\"\n\nObama held a conference call Wednesday with Joe Solomonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, and announced that the Rev. Andy Sidden, an openly gay South Carolina pastor, will appear at the same event as McClurkin on Sunday in Columbia.\n\nSolomonese was not completely assuaged.\n\n\"I spoke with Senator Barack Obama today and expressed to him our community's disappointment for his decision to continue to remain associated with Reverend McClurkin, an anti-gay preacher who states the need to 'break the curse of homosexuality,'\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"There is no gospel in Donnie McClurkin's message for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people and their allies. That's a message that certainly doesn't belong on any presidential candidate's stage.\"\n\nThe State newspaper in Columbia reported Friday that Obama organized a conference call Thursday night with gay and lesbian leaders. After the call, the South Carolina Gay and Lesbian Pride Movement announced it will hold a protest vigil outside Sunday's concert in Columbia.\n\nPrivately, Obama aides say they believe Obama is a candidate of real, transformational change, and that uproars like the McClurkin controversy are necessary speed bumps on the road to bringing people with opposing viewpoints together to air their differences.\n\nWill Obama's refusal to kick McClurkin off the concert bill hurt him? Like many political squabbles, despite the national story, it depends how much the controversy resonates with voters in those crucial early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nAnd in South Carolina, where African Americans make up about half of Democratic primary-goers, voters might not have a problem with McClurkin at all.

And surely, we can arrive at a definition of patriotism that, however rough and imperfect, captures the best of America's common spirit.\"\n\n\n\nObama said that for him, \"patriotism starts as a gut instinct, a loyalty and love for country that's rooted in some of my earliest memories.\"\n\n\n\nObama described how as he grew up, his patriotism matured to something that \"would survive my growing awareness of our nation's imperfections: its ongoing racial strife; the perversion of our political system that were laid bare during the Watergate hearings; the wrenching poverty of the Mississippi Delta and the hills of Appalachia.\"\n\n\n\nObama said he learned that \"what makes America great has never been its perfection, but the belief that it can be made better.\"\n\n\n\nPatriotism, he said, must involve the willingness to sacrifice. He called attention to the service of John McCain, the presumptive Republican candidate.\n\n\n\nMcCain's campaign has been calling on Obama to condemn comments from retired Gen. Wesley Clark, who said this weekend that McCain's service in Vietnam did not necessarily mean that he was qualified to serve as commander-in-chief. Read about what Clark said\n\n\n\nClark is a military adviser for Obama.\n\n\n\nIn his speech Monday, Obama did not directly address Clark's comments, but after calling attention to McCain's service, he said \"no one should ever devalue that service, especially for the sake of a political campaign, and that goes for supporters of both sides.\"\n\n\n\n\"We must always express our profound gratitude for the service of our men and women in uniform. Period,\" he said.\n\n\n\nJust as Obama was finishing his speech, his campaign released a statement about Clark's remarks.\n\n\n\n\"As he's said many times before, Sen. Obama honors and respects Sen. McCain's service, and of course he rejects yesterday's statement by Gen. Clark,\" Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, McCain's campaign announced Monday it was launching a new Truth Squad to defend the Arizona senator's military record.\n\n\n\nLeaders of the latest group include McCain's fellow Vietnam prisoners of war Air Force Col. Bud Day and Marine Lt. Col. Orson Swindle, along with former Navy pilot Carl Smith, who served with him.\n\n\n\nMcCain said Monday he was proud of his record of service.  Watch McCain's response to Clark's comments \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"The important thing is that if that's the kind of campaign that Sen. Obama and his surrogates and his supporters want to engage in, I understand that,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"But it doesn't reduce the price of a gallon of gas by one penny. It doesn't achieve our energy independence or make it come any closer ... and it certainly doesn't do anything to address the challenges that Americans have in keeping their jobs, their homes and supporting their families.\"\n\n\n\nObama was to follow up Monday's speech on patriotism with an address Tuesday about faith and remarks later in the week on service. He will spend his Fourth of July in Butte, Montana, campaigning with his family.\n\n\n\nMcCain on Monday was campaigning in Pennsylvania, a battleground state in the general election. He was scheduled to speak with reporters in Harrisburg before holding a town hall meeting in Pipersville.\n\n\n\nMcCain leaves for Colombia on Tuesday and will travel to Mexico later in the week.\n\n\n\nHis campaign on Monday unveiled his new campaign airplane, a Boeing 737-400.\n\n\n\nThe aircraft shares its name -- the \"Straight Talk Express\" with McCain's  campaign bus, which has been a staple of the candidate's 2000 and 2008 campaigns.\n\n\n\nThe 95-seat plane -- with seats for the candidate, his staffers and the press -- has the \"Straight Talk Express\" logo emblazoned on its fuselage.\n\n\n\nCNN's Tasha Diakides and Chris Welch contributed to this report.", "qa": [{"question": "What did Obama vow never to do?", "answers": ["question the patriotism of others in the campaign,"]}, {"question": "What has McCain unveiled?", "answers": ["launching a new Truth Squad to defend the Arizona senator's military record.", "his new campaign airplane,", "to", "his new campaign airplane, a Boeing 737-400."]}, {"question": "what does obama vow about patriotism?", "answers": ["to never question the", "vowed to never question the", "of others", "of others in the campaign,"]}, {"question": "NEW: Obama vows to never question the patriotism of others in the campaign", "answers": ["vowed"]}, {"question": "what did Clark mention about obama camp?", "answers": ["McCain's service in Vietnam did not necessarily mean that he was qualified to serve as commander-in-chief.", "\"We must always express our profound gratitude for the service of our men and women in uniform."]}, {"question": "What has the Obama camp said?", "answers": ["honors and respects Sen.

Water flows from their taps for just three hours each evening.\n\nA 1961 firetruck loads up with water from a hydrant in Alabama to haul back to Orme, Tennessee.\n\nThe mountain spring that supplies water to the town usually dries up at the end of summer, but just for a few days. This year it dried up early, on August 1, and hasn't revived, leaving the town's 145 residents high and dry and relying on water trucked in from the next state.\n\nEvery day at 6 p.m., Orme Mayor Tony Reames turns a big valve to release water from the town's tank.

Just 150 miles to the southeast, the 4.5 million people who live in and around Atlanta, Georgia, are nervously watching water levels go down at their major reservoir.

{"text": "Editor's note: Campbell Brown anchors CNN's \"Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull\" at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays. She delivered this commentary during the \"Cutting through the Bull\" segment of Tuesday night's broadcast.\n\nCNN's Campbell Brown says \"having no life\" isn't a requirement for a man to get a job.\n\n(CNN) -- How many times have politicians been warned about the dangers of an open microphone? And yet, on Tuesday, the lectern mic at the National Governors Conference picked up this little nugget from Pennsylvania's Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell.\n\nHe's having a conversation near the lectern about President-elect Barack Obama's choice for to lead the Homeland Security Department, Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano. Here is what Rendell said about Napolitano:\n\nRendell: Janet's perfect for that job. Because for that job, you have to have no life. Janet has no family. Perfect. She can devote, literally, 19-20 hours a day to it\n\nWow. Now, I'm sure Gov. Napolitano has many qualifications for the job beyond having no family, and therefore the ability to devote 20 hours a day to the job.  Watch Campbell Brown's commentary \u00c2\u00bb\n\nBut it is fascinating to me that that is the quality being highlighted here as so perfect. C'mon. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff is married with two grown children. His predecessor, Tom Ridge, had a family. Anybody remember a debate about whether they would have trouble balancing the demands of work and family?\n\nNow, I am a fan of Gov. Rendell. He has been on this show many times. I like him for his candor. In our attempts to cut through the bull, he delivers far less bull than most politicians. But it is his frankness here that raises so many questions.\n\n1. If a man had been Obama's choice for the job, would having a family or not having a family ever even have been an issue? Would it have ever prompted a comment? Probably not. We all know the assumption tends to be that with a man, there is almost always a wife in the wings managing those family concerns.\n\n2. As a woman, hearing this, it is hard not to wonder if we are counted out for certain jobs, certain opportunities, because we do have a family or because we are in our child-bearing years. Are we? It is a fair question.\n\n3. If you are a childless, single woman with suspicions that you get stuck working holidays, weekends and the more burdensome shifts more often than your colleagues with families, are those suspicions well-founded? Probably so. Is there an assumption that if you're family-free then you have no life? By some, yes.\n\nAgain Gov. Rendell, I don't mean to rake you over the coals. I know what you meant to say. But your comments do perpetuate stereotypes that put us in boxes, both mothers and single women.\n\nIn government and beyond, men have been given the benefit of the doubt when it comes to striking the right work-life balance.

{"text": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Previously unseen footage of Diana, Princess of Wales, taken just hours before she was killed in a car crash, has been shown to the jury at the inquest into her death.\n\nThe footage showed Diana and Dodi step into an elevator at the Ritz Hotel.\n\nImages taken from a security camera at the Ritz Hotel in Paris show the 36-year-old smiling as she and her lover Dodi Fayed step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel.\n\nFurther footage shows Fayed visiting a jeweler's shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring.\n\nEarlier, a British coroner at the inquest said tt may never be known for certain whether Princess Diana was pregnant when she died in the Paris car crash.\n\nLord Justice Scott Baker told the jury at the inquest into the deaths of the princess and her lover Dodi Fayed that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate \"one way or the other\" whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy.\n\nBut he said they would hear \"intimate\" details of her personal life.  Watch footage of Diana's last hours \u00bb\n\nBaker told the 11 members of the jury -- six women and five men -- Diana may have been on the contraceptive pill and that evidence she was poised to get engaged to Dodi on the night she died was contradictory.\n\nOn Tuesday the judge, who is acting as coroner in the case, told the jury that a famous image taken in summer 1997 showing Diana wearing a swimsuit could not be proof she was pregnant with Dodi's child as she had not started a relationship with him at that stage.\n\nThe jury is set to hear \"scene setting\" evidence, including CCTV and a tourist video.\n\nThe inquest to establish cause of death is expected to be a six-month process.\n\nFayed's father, Mohammed Al Fayed, has contended from the start that Diana and his son were murdered because the royal family \"could not accept that an Egyptian Muslim could eventually be step-father to the future king of England,\" referring to Diana's son Prince William.\n\n\"I'm hoping for justice,\" Al Fayed said outside court. \"At last, we're going to have a jury from ordinary people and I hope to reach the decision which I believe that my son and Princess Diana have been murdered by the royal family.\"\n\nBaker told the jury of Al Fayed's allegations, but again reminded them that they were responsible for deciding the facts of the case, but not to assign blame or guilt.\n\n\"You have to decide four important, but limited factual questions: who the deceased were, when they came by their deaths, where they came by their deaths and how they came by their deaths,\" Baker said, according to inquest transcripts.\n\n\"The first three questions are unlikely to give rise to any difficulty. The fourth is a rather wider question and is directed towards the means by which they died.\"\n\nDiana, 36, and 42-year-old Dodi Fayed were killed on August 31, 1997 when the Mercedes-Benz they were traveling in hit a pillar in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris.\n\nThey were being pursued at the time by the paparazzi after leaving the Ritz Hotel. Driver Henri Paul, who was also killed, was drunk and driving at high speed. Bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was the sole survivor.\n\nNext week, the jury is scheduled to travel to Paris to see the crash site, along the River Seine. They are also expected to hear testimony from the paparazzi who were present after the accident.\n\nIn its evidence section, the Web site for the inquest has posted previously unpublished pictures taken by paparazzi of the limo before and immediately after the accident.\n\nOne is a closeup -- looking into the front of the vehicle -- that shows Diana, Fayed, Paul and Rees-Jones minutes before the crash.

{"text": "(CNN) -- A court in Saudi Arabia has granted an 8-year-old girl a divorce from her 47-year-old husband, after twice denying the divorce request previously, local media reported Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe marriage sparked condemnations around the world from human rights groups and U.S. and other government officials when it first came to light in December.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal media, which is highly regulated by the Saudi government, reported that the court in the city of Onaiza approved the divorce decree Thursday, and the divorce is final.\n\n\n\n\n\nA source at the court told the Saudi daily newspaper Al-Watan that the divorce \"came after a series of pleas made by a number of officials in the region to the husband.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN efforts to reach court officials, the husband and the girl's father have been unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the attorney for the young girl's mother, the father of the girl had arranged the marriage between his daughter and a close friend of his to settle his debts with the man.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the mother went to court to try to get the marriage annulled, Saudi judge Habib al-Habib rejected the request on a legal technicality. The judge ruled that the mother -- who is separated from the girl's father -- was not the child's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court, according to the mother's lawyer, Abdullah al-Jutaili.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the judge required the girl's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty, al-Jutaili said. The lawyer said in the original marriage agreement, the father of the girl stipulated that the marriage would not be consummated until she was 18.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe judge also ruled that the girl could file a petition for a divorce when she reached puberty, al-Jutaili said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe young girl lives with her mother, the attorney said, and was never told that she was married.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the initial petition to annul the marriage was rejected, the mother appealed the verdict to an appeals court in the Saudi capital of Riyadh. The appeals court declined to certify the original ruling, in essence rejecting al-Habib's verdict, and sent the case back to him for reconsideration.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the complicated Saudi legal process, the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect but that a challenge to the marriage was ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, the original judge refused for a second time to annul the marriage.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoon after that decision, Saudi Arabia's justice minister told Al-Watan that he planned to enact a law that will protect young girls from such marriages.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law will place restrictions on the practice to preserve the rights of children and prevent abuses, Justice Minister Mohammed Al-Issa was quoted as saying. Additionally, al-Issa said there would be a study of a system that will include regulations for the marriage of minors and everything related to such unions, the newspaper reported. No details on the restrictions or regulations were mentioned.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe minister did not say whether child marriage would be abolished.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponding to the justice minister's comments and the possibility of a new child marriage law, al-Jutaili told CNN at the time, \"this is what we requested from day one, and we know that Saudi officials are working so hard on resolving this issue.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Jutaili believes that such a law would help not only his defendant but many other Saudi minors facing a similar problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Washington Monday, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs William Burns called the marriage a human rights abuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Child marriage is, unfortunately, still common in much of Saudi Arabia and we have voiced our concern about this practice at the highest levels,\" he told a conference on U.S.-Saudi relations. \"We were encouraged by reports that the Justice Ministry had begun to review the legal age of marriage.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the divorce was denied for a second time, the head of the United Nations Children's Fund issued a statement expressing concern about the case.\n\n\n\n\n\nUNICEF Executive Director Ann Veneman said, \"the right to free and full consent to marriage is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Consent cannot be free and full when either party to a marriage is too young to make an informed decision.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative Saudi kingdom recently. While rights groups have petitioned the government for laws to protect children from such marriages, the kingdom's top cleric has said that it's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is incorrect to say that it's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger,\" Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh, the kingdom's grand mufti, said in January, according to the regional Al-Hayat newspaper. \"A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married. Those who think she's too young are wrong, and they are being unfair to her.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Sheikh reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls,\" he said, according to the newspaper. \"We should know that sharia law has not brought injustice to women.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSharia law is Islamic law, and Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism.", "qa": [{"question": "Who is the Saudi justice minister?", "answers": ["Mohammed Al-Issa"]}, {"question": "What did the father do to settle his debts?", "answers": ["daughter and a close friend of", "close friend", "daughter and", "arranged the marriage between"]}, {"question": "What is the U.N.?", "answers": ["United Nations"]}, {"question": "What did Saudi justice minister say he plans to do?", "answers": ["enact a law that will protect young girls from such marriages.", "planned"]}, {"question": "What law is planned", "answers": ["that will protect young girls from such marriages.", "a"]}, {"question": "What did the child bride win", "answers": ["divorce", "a divorce"]}, {"question": "Who won their divorce hearing on the third attempt?", "answers": ["an 8-year-old girl"]}, {"question": "What did the minister say", "answers": ["he planned to enact a law that will protect young girls from such marriages."]}, {"question": "What is a Child bride?", "answers": ["marriage of minors"]}]}
{"text": "NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Three Staten Island men are charged with violating voting rights, accused of assaulting African-Americans after Barack Obama's win in the November presidential election, authorities said Wednesday.\n\n\n\nA grand jury indicted Ralph Nicoletti, 18, Michael Contreras, 18, and Brian Carranza, 21, on charges of conspiracy to interfere with voting rights. All three pleaded not guilty in federal court Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\n\nAccording to the indictment, the three \"knowingly and intentionally\" conspired to intimidate African-Americans \"in the free exercise and enjoyment of a right ... and because of having so exercised that right, to wit, the right to vote.\"\n\n\n\nNicoletti and Carranza are white, and Contreras is Latino. They face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.\n\n\n\nAt the arraignment, Nicoletti and Contreras were ordered held without bail, while Carranza was released on a $200,000 bond but ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device.\n\n\n\nContreras' attorney, public defender Len Kamdang, could not be reached for comment. Nicoletti's attorney, Bob LaRusso, had no comment.\n\n\n\nProsecutors said in court filings that on the night of November 4, the defendants were at a \"makeshift outdoor clubhouse\" in the Rosebank section of Staten Island when they learned of Obama's victory. At that point, prosecutors said, Nicoletti drove Contreras, Carranza and another friend to the predominantly African-American Park Hill neighborhood in Staten Island.\n\n\n\nTheir purpose, prosecutors said, was to assault African-Americans because of Obama's win.\n\n\n\nTheir first victim, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office, was 17-year-old Ali Kamara, whom they beat with a metal pipe and a collapsible police baton. Kamara escaped after suffering a concussion and injuries to his legs.\n\n\n\n\"The first swing that swung -- it hit my head. It cut my head,\" Kamara told CNN affiliate WABC. \"I got staples on my head now.\"\n\n\n\nKamara said he hid in a neighbor's backyard until the boys moved on.\n\n\n\nContinuing to the Port Richmond section of Staten Island, the group assaulted a second African-American man, pushing him down, the federal prosecutors alleged. They then allegedly accosted a Latino man, demanding to know how he voted, and shouted profanities about Obama at a group of African-Americans at a hair salon.\n\n\n\nNext, prosecutors said, the group targeted Ronald Forte, a man they mistakenly believed to be African-American who was walking along Blackford Avenue in predominantly African-American Port Richmond. Forte is white, but because he was wearing a hoodie, the men were unable to identify his race and assumed that he was African-American.\n\n\n\nAccording to the indictment, the men decided to assault Forte with the police baton as they drove by, but at the last moment, Nicoletti swerved the vehicle directly into the 38-year-old man instead. Forte was thrown onto the hood of the car, shattering the front windshield.\n\n\n\nAccording to Staten Island Real Time News (silive.com), Forte was in a coma for 45 days, returning to his family's home in New Jersey in mid-December, said his mother, Eileen. She added that her son now has serious brain damage and motor control problems.\n\n\n\n\"He's not good.

{"text": "(CNN) -- The Catholic bishop of South Bend, Indiana, will not attend graduation ceremonies at the University of Notre Dame because he disagrees with the stem-cell research and abortion views of the commencement speaker -- President Obama.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe University of Notre Dame says its invitation doesn't mean the university agrees with all of Obama's positions.\n\n\n\n\n\nBishop John D'Arcy, whose diocese includes Fort Wayne, Indiana, as well as the university town, said Tuesday in a written statement that \"after much prayer\" he has decided not to attend the ceremony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"President Obama has recently reaffirmed, and has now placed in public policy, his long-stated unwillingness to hold human life as sacred,\" D'Arcy said. \"While claiming to separate politics from science, he has in fact separated science from ethics and has brought the American government, for the first time in history, into supporting direct destruction of innocent human life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Obama reversed a federal ban on embryonic stem-cell research. Many scientists say the research could lead to advances in treating conditions like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, while some abortion opponents believe destroying embryos in the research amounts to ending a human life.  Watch Obama called \"premier promoter of baby-killing\" \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January, Obama lifted a Bush administration restriction on funding for organizations that provide or promote abortion overseas.\n\n\n\n\n\nD'Arcy's announcement comes as anti-abortion groups have launched campaigns attempting to persuade the Catholic university to rescind Obama's invitation. In a letter to Notre Dame, Anthony J.

{"text": "(CNN) -- Some Democrats say they fear their party's method of picking a nominee might turn undemocratic as neither presidential candidate is likely to gather the delegates needed for the nomination.\n\n\n\nThe Democrats' superdelegate system is supposed to avoid turmoil at the party's conventions.\n\n\n\nSens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are running neck and neck toward the party's August convention in Denver, Colorado. Most projections show neither getting the necessary 2,025 delegates in the remaining nominating contests before then.\n\n\n\nParty rules call for the votes of superdelegates -- 800 or so party officers, elected officials and activists -- to tip the balance. The party instituted the system to avoid the turmoil that a deadlocked race would create at a convention.\n\n\n\nBut even some superdelegates are questioning the system, as the party heads toward the conclusion of a race in which they might determine the outcome.\n\n\n\n\"It's not the most democratic way of doing things,\" said Maine superdelegate Sam Spencer.  Watch the scenario for a \"civil war\" in the Democratic Party \u00bb\n\n\n\nAt least two organizations have launched petition drives to reflect how the vote went in primaries and caucuses.\n\n\n\nMoveOn.org, which has endorsed Obama, is trying to get 200,000 signatures this week and plans to run an ad with its petition in USA Today. And Democracy for America, headed by Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean's brother Jim, said it will deliver signed petitions to all the superdelegates.\n\n\n\nWhile pledged delegates are allocated with the understanding they'll vote the way their state went in its primary or caucus, superdelegates are free to vote however they want. And even if they pledge their support to a candidate, they're free to change at any time.\n\n\n\nClinton already has 234 superdelegates and Obama has 157. But Obama has a sizable lead in pledged delegates, 1,096 to 977, and is on a roll, having won all eight nominating contests since Super Tuesday.  See which states pledged delegates come from \u00bb\n\n\n\nIf the superdelegates were to tip the balance against the popular vote, the turmoil would last long beyond the convention, longtime Democratic Party strategist Tad Devine said.\n\n\n\n\"If a perception develops that somehow this decision has been made not by voters participating in primaries or caucuses, but by politicians in some mythical backroom, I think that the public could react strongly against that,\" Devine said.\n\n\n\n\"The problem is [if] people perceive that voters have not made the decision -- instead, insiders have made the decision -- then all of these new people who are being attracted to the process, particularly the young people who are voting for the first time, will feel disenfranchised or in some way alienated,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSuperdelegates were established in 1982 to bring more moderate Democrats back to conventions, where their attendance had been dropping since the 1950s, and to relect the party's mainstream more accurately.\n\n\n\n\"[Superdelegates] are the keepers of the faith,\" said former San Francisco, California, Mayor Willie Brown. \"You have superdelegates because this is the Democratic Party. You don't want the bleed-over from the Green Party, the independents and others in deciding who your nominee will be.\"\n\n\n\nDevine was part of the first campaign to benefit from the roles of superdelegates -- that of former Vice President Walter Mondale in 1984.\n\n\n\nMondale's 1984 campaign went into the party convention with too few delegates to secure the nomination against the campaigns of former Sen. Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson. Mondale had received more votes, but Hart had won more states.\n\n\n\nMondale was able to line up the superdelegates going into the convention and avoid a fight on the convention floor.\n\n\n\nEach campaign actively is trying to encourage the unpledged delegates to pledge to their side.\n\n\n\nJason Rae, a 21-year-old Wisconsin superdelegate, said he's gotten calls from former President Clinton and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright from Hillary Clinton's camp, and Obama's wife, Michelle, visited with him during a campaign stop Tuesday in Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nRae said he hasn't yet decided how he'll vote in Wisconsin's primary on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nCrystal Strait, a party activist from California, said she's received calls from Clinton herself and daughter Chelsea but she remains uncommitted.\n\n\n\nMassachusetts superdelegate John Walsh said he'll stay loyal to Obama despite the fact that the senator lost the primary in Walsh's state. So will fellow Massachusetts superdelegates Sens. Edward Kennedy and John Kerry.\n\n\n\nAmong Clinton's committed superdelegates are Harold Ickes Jr., her husband's former deputy chief of staff; Terry McAuliffe, who led her husband's 1996 re-election campaign and is chairman of her campaign; and her husband.\n\n\n\nWhether those superdelegates stay committed to their candidates, even if it means tipping the outcome of the race against the pledged delegate lead or the popular vote, could split the party.\n\n\n\n\"It's in a total contradiction of the way the Democrats have set up their primary process, with all this proportional representation,\" said CNN political analyst Amy Holmes. \"The whole point of it was that no one could walk away with the elites. And if this is decided by superdelegates, I think the Democratic Party morally is going to be looking at each other and say, 'What did we just do?' \"\n\n\n\nDevine said it could hurt the party in the general election.\n\n\n\n\"I think it will hurt us particularly because so many of the policies that we're saying we will pursue in government as Democrats are based on fairness, whether it's the tax policies that we advocate or the social programs we want to advance, there's a fairness component in all of that,\" he said. \"People need to believe, I think, that our process is fair as well, if they want to believe that our policies will be fair.\" E-mail to a friend\n\n\n\nCNN's Campbell Brown, John Helton and Ed Hornick contributed to this report.", "qa": [{"question": "What number of superdelegates was there?", "answers": ["800", "800 or so"]}, {"question": "What do some people fear?", "answers": ["their party's method of picking a nominee might turn undemocratic"]}, {"question": "Who can superdelegates vote for?", "answers": ["superdelegates are free to vote however they want.", "are free to", "however they want."]}, {"question": "Do superdelegates get to choose their vote?", "answers": ["are free", "however they want."]}, {"question": "What could tip the balance against the popular vote?", "answers": ["of superdelegates", "the"]}, {"question": "Do voters think this is a fair system?", "answers": ["our process", "might turn undemocratic"]}, {"question": "What number of superdelegates are there?", "answers": ["800 or so"]}, {"question": "What would happen to voters?", "answers": ["public could react strongly against that,\""]}, {"question": "What is the difference between delegates and superdelegates?", "answers": ["however they want.", "or caucus,", "are allocated with the understanding they'll vote the way their state went in", "are free"]}, {"question": "What is the number of superdelegates?", "answers": ["Clinton already has 234", "and Obama has 157.", "800 or so"]}, {"question": "What can superdelegates do?", "answers": ["tip the balance.", "are free to vote however they want."]}, {"question": "What is the number of superdelegates for the Democrats?", "answers": ["800", "2,025"]}]}

{"text": "(CNN) -- A federal immigration board rejected an emergency appeal Friday for a stay of deportation filed by the lawyer for Nazi war crimes suspect John Demjanjuk.\n\n\n\nJohn Demjanjuk, shown at his 1993 Israel acquittal, is sought by Germany for alleged killings at a Nazi camp.\n\n\n\nThe decision by the Department of Justice's Board of Immigration Appeals in Falls Church, Virginia, clears the way for Demjanjuk's deportation to Germany, where he is being sought for his alleged involvement during World War II in killings at Sobibor, a Nazi death camp in Poland.\n\n\n\nThe deportation of Demjanjuk would close a chapter in one of the longest-running pursuits of an alleged Holocaust perpetrator in history, while also paving the way for an extraordinary German war crimes trial.\n\n\n\nAgents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement are now free to pick up Demjanjuk at any point and take him into custody for transport to Germany, a board official said.\n\n\n\nThe appeals board rejected Demjanjuk's emergency stay request because it concluded \"there is little likelihood of success that his pending motion to re-open the case will be granted,\" according to board officials.\n\n\n\nThe pending motion argues that a deportation of Demjanjuk, 89, to Germany would constitute torture.\n\n\n\n\"In the four years since his deportation was [initially] ordered, his health has seriously deteriorated,\" Demjanjuk's attorney, John Broadley, told CNN in a recent telephone interview.\n\n\n\nBroadley said Demjanjuk suffers from pre-leukemia, kidney problems, spinal problems and \"a couple of types of gout.\"\n\n\n\nThe board, however, has already signaled that argument will be rejected.\n\n\n\nDemjanjuk may make an additional expedited appeal for an emergency stay to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, though his chances of getting the board's ruling overturned are believed to be slim, according to Justice Department officials.\n\n\n\nRabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center found irony in Broadley's argument for his client.\n\n\n\n\"He wants to plead the sense of fairness that he regularly denied all of the victims at Sobibor,\" Hier said.\n\n\n\nHier called Demjanjuk's comparison of his planned deportation to torture \"preposterous coming from a person that served the [Nazi organization] S.S. in a death camp. It is a preposterous argument and insulting to the survivors of the Holocaust.\"\n\n\n\nHier said that 250,000 Jews were killed at the camp, and that none of the guards who worked there was blameless. \"You were there for one job: kill the Jews,\" he said. \"And that's what they did full-time.\"\n\n\n\nHe called the evidence against Demjanjuk \"overwhelming.\"\n\n\n\nGerman authorities issued an arrest warrant for Demjanjuk on March 10, accusing him of being an accessory to 29,000 counts of murder as a guard at the death camp from March to September 1943.\n\n\n\nThey studied an identification card provided by the U.S. Office of Special Investigations, and concluded it was genuine, before issuing the warrant.\n\n\n\nDemjanjuk, a retired autoworker living in Cleveland, Ohio, has been fighting charges of Nazi war crimes for more than two decades. He was previously extradited from the United States to Israel, where he was convicted in 1986 of being \"Ivan the Terrible,\" a guard at the notorious Treblinka extermination camp. The conviction was overturned by Israeli courts on appeal, and he returned to the United States.\n\n\n\nThe United States filed new charges against him in 1999, again alleging that he had been a concentration camp guard.

{"text": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- There are some circuits that are cornerstones of the Formula 1 calendar: the Monacos and Silverstones whose every twist and turn are known intimately by the drivers and engineers. Then there are the newer circuits -- Malaysia and Bahrain, for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins.\n\nFuji Speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view.\n\nNext week they have something completely new to contend with: a track that has yet to see a single F1 team put in a single lap. The Japan Grand Prix is to return to the Fuji Speedway, a circuit that hasn't seen an F1 race since 1977 (though now with a substantially different track layout).\n\nThe Fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games. The old Fuji Speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game Pole Position (released by Namco in Japan and Atari in the rest of the world). The most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest mountain, looming in the distance. Though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies.\n\nThe Suzuka track -- which had held Japanese Grands Prix between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike, but for this year and the next the Japanese Grand Prix will be held at Fuji.\n\nHowever an announcement by Formula One Management (FOM) this month revealed that Suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the Japanese Grand Prix alternating yearly between Fuji and Suzuka after that.\n\nBehind the scenes is a political battleground -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with F1 connections -- Honda owns Suzuka, Toyota owns Fuji. Toyota is a relative newcomer to F1 but, having this year surpassed General Motors as the world's number one automobile manufacturer, and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock (a position that hasn't been reflected in sporting success), it is not without clout.\n\nThe redesign of the Fuji track was carried out by Hermann Tilke in 2003. Tilke, a German architect redesigned a number of F1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including Malaysia, Istanbul, Bahrain and Shanghai, and the tracks for 2008's debut grands prix in Singapore and Valencia.\n\nSo how do F1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as Fuji without data from previous races to fall back on? The answer lies with computer simulation.\n\nComputer-aided design (CAD) is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high-tech cars. Every bend, every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself.\n\nDespite never having raced on the circuit, the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual Fuji Speedway for some time. BMW Sauber's simulation experts received CAD data from the Japanese race organizers late last year. And when their cars arrive at Fuji for testing next week, their race set-up should be close to optimum.\n\nThe circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments. The radius of each individual segment was measured, allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line (the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance).\n\nThen the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated. The slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car.\n\n\"In order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend, we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels, gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance,\" says Willy Rampf, Technical Director of the BMW Sauber F1 Team.\n\nDieter Glass, Chief Race and Test Engineer with Toyota F1 explains:\n\n\"You start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit. Once you know that, you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce, before you get into more detailed simulations of different set-up solutions.\n\n\"Getting a bit closer to the weekend, you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy. This prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track, like the degradation of the two Bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time. If you have more fuel in the car, this affects your lap time, but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried.\"\n\nOne peculiarity of the Fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight, which at 1.475 km (0.916 miles) will allow for higher-than average-straight line speeds but, after the straight the track is relatively twisty. The teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight, and the best grip decelerating into the bends.\n\n\"You have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip,\" says Glass, \"and as always you want good grip in general, but you have to balance that with the long straight, where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed.\"\n\nThe testing may be virtual, but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair's breadth away from real world eventualities:\n\n\"Our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values,\" says Rampf.\n\nNot that everything can be predicted: \"I think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race,\" continues Glass.\n\n\"Many incidents can happen, which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy.\" E-mail to a friend", "qa": [{"question": "What way are teams being prepared for familar circuit", "answers": ["Computer-aided design (CAD)", "computer simulation."]}, {"question": "Which is re designed?", "answers": ["the Fuji track"]}, {"question": "when did fuji speedway host the first japanese grand prix", "answers": ["1977"]}, {"question": "Which other circuit will alternate with Fuji?", "answers": ["Suzuka", "and Suzuka", "alternating yearly between"]}, {"question": "When was the last time Fuji Speedway hosted the Japanese Grand Prix?", "answers": ["1977"]}, {"question": "Who are computer models being used for in preparation of unfamiliar circuits?", "answers": ["the 1982 arcade game", "was the setting"]}, {"question": "When is first Japanese Grand Prix hosted?", "answers": ["Suzuka track", "2009", "Next week"]}, {"question": "Who alternates with Fuji from 2009?", "answers": ["Suzuka", "Japan Grand Prix"]}, {"question": "What is used  to prepare teams for the unfamiliar circuit?", "answers": ["predict the optimum race strategy.", "computer simulation.", "fastidiously analyzed on screen", "virtual Fuji Speedway", "balance", "testing their cars on", "find"]}, {"question": "What is preparing teams?", "answers": ["virtual Fuji Speedway", "computer simulation."]}, {"question": "When will Suzuka alternate with Fuji from?", "answers": ["this year and the next", "Japanese Grand Prix", "2009", "yearly"]}, {"question": "What is used to prepare teams for the circuit?", "answers": ["scale model", "computer simulation.", "scale model of the new", "cars on", "virtual Fuji Speedway", "Computer-aided design (CAD)", "testing"]}, {"question": "Where will the first Japanese Grand Prix since 1977 be hosted?", "answers": ["Fuji Speedway,"]}]}
{"text": "(CNN) -- Searchers have recovered the bodies of three people who were aboard a Yemenia Airways jet that crashed off the coast of Comoros in the Indian Ocean, a spokesman for Yemen's Civil Aviation department said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nA man hugs a relative of one of the victims at an airport in Marseille in southern France.\n\n\n\nCapt. Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Qadir also told reporters that a child who was reported found alive was a 5-year-old boy. He did not give further details of the child's condition.\n\n\n\n\"The French said that (Wednesday) they will send more French units to the accident location in order to retrieve the bodies and possibly that they may be able to locate people who are still alive,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe Airbus 310 went down early Tuesday, carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members on a flight that originated in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. Qadir said the jet took off from Sanaa shortly before 10 p.m. Monday and vanished from radar when it was about 16 miles from Comoros' capital, Moroni.\n\n\n\nSearchers have not located the plane's data recorders, Qadir said, and investigators were not speculating on the cause of the crash.\n\n\n\n\"The weather conditions were indeed very troubling and the winds were very strong, reaching 61 kilometers per hour (38 mph),\" he said. \"That's one thing. The other thing was that the sea was very rough when the plane approached landing at Moroni airport.\"\n\n\n\nBut French Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau noted that several years ago France banned the plane, a A310-300, because of safety concerns.\n\n\n\n\"People are talking about poor weather conditions, but for the moment, we are unsure,\" Bussereau said. \"It seems the plane may have attempted an approach, put on the gas, and attempted another approach, which then failed. For the moment, we must be careful because none of this information is verified.\"\n\n\n\nQadir said it was too early to blame the aircraft for the crash.\n\n\n\n\"This plane is just like any other plane,\" he said. \"It can have a malfunction, but we don't know what really happened before the investigation is over. And then we can determine if there is a technical issue, bad weather or anything else that may have led to the crash.\"\n\n\n\nIt was the second crash involving an Airbus jet in a month. On June 1, an Air France Airbus A330 crashed off Brazil while en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France. All 228 aboard are presumed dead. The cause remains under investigation.  Recent plane crashes \u00bb\n\n\n\nFormer pilot and aviation analyst John Cox said there were no similarities between the two incidents.\n\n\n\n\"These are two dramatically different airplanes flown by two different airlines,\" Cox told CNN's \"American Morning.\"\n\n\n\n\"The accidents happened at two different regimes of flight. And Airbus has hundreds of millions of hours flying safely. I don't believe that ... we can draw any conclusions because the manufacturer was the same in these two very different types of accidents.\"\n\n\n\nAt first, Comoros officials said there were no signs of survivors among the dead bodies floating in the choppy waters. But then rescuers found the child.  Watch as airline describes child's rescue \u00bb\n\n\n\nCox said it reminded him of the 1987 crash of Northwest Flight 255 in Detroit, Michigan, in which only a 4-year-old girl survived while 156 others died.\n\n\n\n\"This has come up before, and it's where the toddler was seated (during the impact) that allowed them to survive,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"It's a miracle and I'm glad ... the toddler is safe. I'm just saddened for the loss of everybody else,\" he added.\n\n\n\nThe Yemeni crash occurred as the plane approached the Hahaya airport in Moroni. The plane tried to land, then U-turned before it crashed, Comoros Vice President Idi Nadhoim said. Officials did not know why the plane could not land, he said.\n\n\n\nFlight 626 was expected to be a four-and-a-half-hour flight. The airline has three regular flights a week to Moroni, off the east coast of Africa, about 2,900 km (1,800 miles) south of Yemen.\n\n\n\nThe crash occurred about 1:30 a.m., Nadhoim said.\n\n\n\nThere was no indication of foul play behind the crash, the official in Yemen said.\n\n\n\nYemenia Air had used the jet since 1999 on about 17,300 flights, Airbus officials said. The company said it would assist in investigating the crash.\n\n\n\n\"The concerns and sympathy of the Airbus employees go to the families, friends and loved ones affected by the accident,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the Air France crash on June 1, United States accident investigators have been probing two recent failures of airspeed and altitude indications aboard Airbus A330s.   One flight was between the United States and Brazil in May, and the other between Hong Kong and Japan in June. The planes landed safely and there were no injuries or damage, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\n\n\nCNN's Saad Abedine and Ayesha Durgahee contributed to this report", "qa": [{"question": "Which country is sending a team?", "answers": ["French"]}, {"question": "Where was a 5-year old boy recovered from?", "answers": ["off the coast of Comoros in the Indian Ocean,", "Yemenia Airways jet", "off the coast of Comoros"]}, {"question": "Was the child recovered from the Yemeni jet crash found alive?", "answers": ["who", "bodies of three people", "reported", "a 5-year-old boy."]}, {"question": "How many people were aboard the Jet?", "answers": ["228", "142 passengers and 11 crew members", "three"]}, {"question": "Who was recovered alive from the crash?", "answers": ["a 5-year-old boy.", "reported found", "child"]}, {"question": "How many bodies have been found?", "answers": ["156", "three"]}, {"question": "When did the crash occur?", "answers": ["early Tuesday,", "off the coast of Comoros", "Monday"]}, {"question": "How many people was the jet carrying?", "answers": ["142 passengers and 11 crew members"]}]}

{"text": "(CNN) -- Decorating in the midst of a financial recession is not easy. But Thom Filicia, host of the Style Network's \"Dress My Nest,\" author of \"Thom Filicia Style\" and former cast member of \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,\" insists that it can be done.\n\n\"Paint is very affordable. Pick a color that has life and personality,\" Thom Filicia says.\n\n\"I always tell people, 'Start with what you have.' Work as much with what you have as possible, and then fill in where necessary,\" Filicia said.\n\nCNN recently asked the design guru about decorating on a budget and helpful tips to make your home look its best.\n\nCNN: When you walk into a room that you're going to redesign, where does your mind first go?\n\nThom Filicia: I look at the layout, I look at the way the space is being used, and I try to figure out what the best use of the space is; that it works really well, it looks good, that you're getting the best views, you're seeing the space, and that you're getting through the space.\n\nCNN: And that's focusing mainly on furniture?\n\nFilicia: That really focuses on all the furniture. You want to look at where the rug is and where the sofa is and coffee tables and chairs -- just how the room works. Even if it's great-looking stuff, it sometimes doesn't look as good as it can look.\n\nCNN: What can people on a tight budget do to rearrange their living room and make it look better with what they have?\n\nFilicia: Make sure that your furniture layout works. Make sure that the things you love to look at, you're seeing. Make sure things aren't cluttered.\n\nPaint is very affordable. Pick a color that has life and personality. You could do an accent wall behind your sofa. You could use a low-[volatile organic compound] paint so it's environmentally friendly.\n\nYou can use inexpensive up lights. You put them on either side of a piece of furniture or behind a tree. You always want to have a Lutron dimmer you plug into the wall. And then plug your lamps into the Lutron dimmer, and you can dim the whole room.\n\nCNN: As far as accessories go, like flowers and pillows, where do you draw the line on too much or not enough?\n\nFilicia: I like to keep things clean and straightforward. I think one floral arrangement is usually enough, or maybe a couple really small cute little ones.\n\nPillows should function. You want to sit on a sofa and be comfortable. Start with three: one lumbar in the center and maybe a pair of pillows left and right. Add a throw, a rug for underfoot. Those things start to add layers to the room and make it a little more acoustical.\n\nCNN: What are some common designing rules that people always tend to follow but that you can actually break?\n\nFilicia: People think that dark walls make a room smaller. It actually makes the space bigger. All the corners recede, and it adds a lot of depth. Also, I think that color definitely adds a lot of warmth to spaces.\n\nCNN: What's the most common mistake that people make?\n\nFilicia: People just don't trust their instincts, and they're not willing to take a risk. Have fun with it. It's only decorating. People tend to go with beige and white just because they're afraid or they don't want to make a commitment.\n\nCNN: If someone had just enough money to do one thing in their room, what would you tell them to focus on?\n\nFilicia: The first thing you want to really focus on is a great sofa, because it is really the anchor for the room. In a bedroom, the anchor piece is your bed. Start with your anchor piece, and that's where you spend your most money.\n\nCNN: You have a new book out now, is that right?\n\nFilicia: Yup, I have a book out right now, which is called \"Thom Filicia Style,\" and it's a great book. It's a lot of fun. It's got a lot of great tips in it. It talks about my philosophy; it talks about color and texture. It's a very comprehensive book with case studies.\n\nCNN: Can you give us some tips for making a place eco-friendly on a tight budget?\n\nFilicia: It's very easy to use eco-friendly cleaning supplies, environmentally friendly lighting throughout your house using low wattage or eco-friendly bulbs. Also, just turning your lights off when you're not in a room; when you're brushing your teeth not keeping the water running; taking shorter showers.

After what American soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are asked to sacrifice, there is something melancholy about the thought of them coming home and having trouble finding a way to support their families.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nation is likely to work on a solution to this honorably and in good faith.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a time, during parallel circumstances, when that wasn't the case. It was one of the darkest moments in American history, and few people speak about it anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shorthand for it was \"the Bonus Army.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the spring and summer of 1932, with the Great Depression gripping the country, tens of thousands of World War I veterans and their families gathered in Washington to demand what they felt they had been promised. They set up shantytowns, and vowed to stay put until their entreaties were met.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government had, in 1924, issued service certificates -- redeemable for bonuses -- to the soldiers who had returned from World War I. The certificates were intended to reward the veterans for the time they had spent fighting for their country. They were like long-term bonds -- they could not be redeemed until 1945.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut something happened between 1924 and 1932: The economy collapsed. Poverty and joblessness were everywhere. The veterans, many of them hungry and destitute, came to Washington asking Congress to allow them to collect their bonuses early.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt didn't happen. The U.S. Senate voted down the bill.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo there were the military veterans, amassed in the nation's capital. Out of money, out of luck, almost out of hope, they refused to leave. The government ordered their evacuation. Many of the veterans resisted; the police shot and killed two of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith that, the president of the United States, Herbert Hoover, fearing that radicals had infiltrated the veterans, ordered the Army to take over the involuntary evacuation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this country was confronted with the news that the Army was moving against the old soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the highest level of the Army assigned to the task were men who would later become extraordinarily famous. Gen. Douglas MacArthur was in command; Maj. Dwight D. Eisenhower was the go-between with the local police force; Maj. George Patton was in charge of the cavalry.\n\n\n\n\n\nBayonets were drawn; tanks and soldiers on horseback advanced into the crowds; acrid gas was unleashed on the protesting veterans; the makeshift camps were torn down. Even though President Hoover didn't want it to happen, MacArthur sent his troops across a bridge to the site of the veterans' main living quarters. A fire broke out; it was never determined with certainty who set it, but there it was: the American veterans' cobbled-together homes in flames, as the Army drove them out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was no television back then; it is almost impossible to fathom what would have happened if the country had been able to see, live, the military moving relentlessly against former members of the military who were asking for the means to survive.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs rugged as the economy is now -- and as difficult a time as some veterans are having as they look for work in a dismal hiring environment -- no one foresees a day when soldiers will again be ordered to roust former soldiers and their families.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater in their lives, MacArthur, Eisenhower and Patton all lamented, with varying degrees of emotion, having had to play a role in driving the Bonus Army out of Washington. Their commander in chief had decreed that it must be done, so they carried out his orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've come a long way since then; no president with an eye toward his legacy would order the Army to do such a thing, and it's hard to believe that military officials would not, behind closed doors, try everything in their power to avoid having to use American troops that way.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as much as things have changed, certain truths haven't. We ask our soldiers, in times of war, to cross the oceans and fight in our name. When they come home -- those who do come home alive -- we tell them, in bad economic times, that the jobs for them are just not there.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf our soldiers want to work, we owe it to them to make it easier for that to happen. There may never again, we should hope, be a Bonus Army camped in the streets of Washington, pleading for help. The best way to prevent such a sight is to provide the help before the despair of the unemployed veterans reaches that breaking point. You might call it our patriotic duty.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.", "qa": [{"question": "In what year were jobless veterans chased out of Washington by the army?", "answers": ["1932,", "1924"]}, {"question": "Among which group do we have a serious unemployment problem?", "answers": ["male veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars."]}, {"question": "Who says people have a tendency to think we live in the worst of times?", "answers": ["USA Today"]}, {"question": "Today's troubles are not equal to when?", "answers": ["spring and summer of 1932, with the Great Depression gripping the country, tens of thousands of World War I veterans and their families gathered in Washington to demand what they felt they had been promised.", "the president of the United States, Herbert Hoover,", "ordered the Army to take over the involuntary evacuation.", "1932,", "In"]}, {"question": "Who chased jobless veterans protesting out of Washington?", "answers": ["the Army"]}, {"question": "What does Bob Green say people tend to think of the times we are living in?", "answers": ["it's never been", "bitterness is unprecedented.", "quite this dismal before."]}, {"question": "Who chased jobless veterans out of Washington in 1932?", "answers": ["The government", "MacArthur, Eisenhower and Patton", "government"]}, {"question": "Who said People have a tendency to think we live in the worst of times?", "answers": ["Bob Greene"]}, {"question": "Who does Greene say has a serious unemployment problem?", "answers": ["male veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars."]}]}
{"text": "Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama took the push for his stalled $447 billion jobs plan to North Carolina on Monday, telling two audiences that alternative proposals put forward by his Republican critics amount to little more than sops to the rich that will gut critical regulations and fail to restore economic growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy \"bill will help put people back to work and give our economy a boost right away,\" Obama told a morning crowd at Asheville Regional Airport. \"But apparently, none of this matters\" to GOP leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've gone out of my way to find areas of cooperation\" with congressional Republicans, the president declared. \"We're going to give members of Congress another chance to step up to the plate and do the right thing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut \"if they vote against these proposals again ... then they're not going to have to answer to me. They're going to have to answer to you,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater Monday, Obama told students at West Wilkes High School in Millers Creek that Republican opposition to his plan \"makes no sense,\" and he criticized the GOP alternative proposal as an attempt to satisfy the party's conservative wing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's way overdue for us to stop trying to satisfy some branch of the party and take some common-sense steps to help\" the economy and the nation, he said to a cheering crowd.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Obama's plan was rejected in the Senate -- due to unanimous GOP opposition -- Democratic leaders have decided to try to move it through Congress by breaking it up into a series of smaller legislative proposals.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut his appearance, analysts note, was as much about campaign politics as the bill. The president will spend the next three days on a bus tour through politically pivotal North Carolina and Virginia -- two states carried by Obama in 2008 but considered up for grabs next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nVeteran Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, whom Obama defeated in the 2008 election, criticized the president Monday for using the taxpayer-funded trip for what McCain called political campaigning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On the taxpayer-paid dime, the president is now traveling, attacking the Republican plan,\" McCain said on the Senate floor. While noting Obama's right to level such criticism in a political venue, McCain added: \"Is that appropriate on the taxpayer's dime, since it is clearly campaigning?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Asheville, the crowd repeatedly chanted \"four more years\" before and during Obama's remarks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I appreciate the 'four more years,' but right now, I'm thinking about the next 13 months,\" the president said. \"We don't have time to wait. We've got a choice right now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nObama's senior strategist, David Axelrod, vowed Sunday that every part of the bill will eventually have a vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The American people support every single plank of that bill, and we're going to vote on every single one of them,\" Axelrod said on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe would not say which part of the plan would come first.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans will \"get a vote on whether they believe we should protect tax breaks for small business owners and middle-class Americans, or whether we should protect tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires,\" Obama said in a written statement last Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, demonstrators in Southern California said they'd gather Monday to protest the GOP's stance on the president's jobs bill. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and California Reps. Dana Rohrabacher and Ed Royce will be together in the area for a fundraising event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Members of the Courage Campaign, teachers and health care workers will deliver a petition to Speaker Boehner signed by 25,000 Courage Campaign members ... demanding that he hold a vote on President Obama's American Jobs Act,\" a statement from the demonstrators said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said over the weekend that there could be agreement on some elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Let's work together. Let's find some of the things in his plan that we agree with, and let's go ahead and do that for the American people,\" he told \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe past week was an indication that \"we can come together,\" Cantor said, citing the passage of three trade bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nCantor did not make clear exactly where areas of agreement may be. But he cited the need to help small businesses find capital, unemployment insurance reform and infrastructure spending as broad ideas for which both sides have expressed support.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut \"we're not going to be for tax increases on small businesses,\" Cantor said of the president's plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans filibustered the Senate version of the president's jobs bill last week, though a handful of Democrats had said they would have opposed the measure if it had made it to the chamber's floor.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong other things, Obama's overall blueprint includes an extension and expansion of the current payroll tax cut, an extension of jobless benefits, new tax credits for businesses that hire the long-term unemployed and additional money to help save and create jobs for teachers and first responders such as firefighters.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe largest measure in the package is the payroll tax cut, which comes at a projected cost of $265 billion. Employees normally pay 6.2% on their first $106,800 of wages into Social Security, but they are now paying only 4.2%. That break is set to expire at the end of December. Obama wants to cut the tax in half, to 3.1%.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans previously embraced the cut, but have increasingly questioned its economic merit.\n\n\n\n\n\nA second key measure -- estimated to cost roughly $44 billion -- is the extension of emergency jobless benefits to help the long-term unemployed. Lawmakers first expanded benefits to cover 99 weeks in 2009, and have since reauthorized the expansion five times.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans are at particularly sharp odds with Democrats over how to pay for the plan. GOP leaders oppose a provision that would fund the measure through a 5.6% surtax on annual incomes over $1 million. Republicans have accused the president of engaging in so-called \"class warfare,\" while Democrats say wealthier Americans need to share in the cost of fiscal responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, a Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN that Democrats will seek a 0.5% surtax on annual incomes over $1 million to pay for the first individual component of Obama's broader jobs package.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat component of the larger jobs bill would provide $35 billion in aid to states to help preserve jobs for teachers and first responders, the White House and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's office said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a top Senate Republican leadership aide immediately said that Republicans -- and some Democrats -- probably would not be willing to go along with a tax increase to pay for the measure.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Ted Barrett, Kate Bolduan and Virginia Nicolaidis contributed to this report.", "qa": [{"question": "The White House has called on what to pass the jobs bill incrementally?", "answers": ["you,\"", "Republicans"]}, {"question": "How many days is the visit to North Carolina and Virginia?", "answers": ["three"]}, {"question": "who visits North Carolina and Virginia?", "answers": ["Barack Obama", "President Barack Obama", "The president"]}, {"question": "The two states are key battlegrounds", "answers": ["Virginia", "North Carolina"]}, {"question": "Who says Obama is campaigning on a taxpayer-funded trip?", "answers": ["John McCain,", "McCain"]}, {"question": "who criticized Obama?", "answers": ["John McCain,", "Sen.

{"text": "(CNN) -- Comedian George Carlin, known for pushing the envelope with his use of profanity and for pointing out the silliness and hypocrisy of human life, died of heart failure Sunday. He was 71.\n\n\n\niReporter Kevin Eckhoff met George Carlin at a show in St. Louis, Missouri, in 2004.\n\n\n\niReporter Chris Sargent says, \"He could play with words and phrases in ways that would put the most highly regarded English professors and linguists to shame.\"\n\n\n\nCNN.com invited readers to share tales of meeting Carlin, and the impact he had on their lives. Below is a selection of their responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\n\nMelanie Phillips of Salem, Oregon: I met George Carlin in the early '70s at a performance he gave at Los Angeles Valley College. The large auditorium was filled to capacity so they closed the doors leaving about 40 people outside. When Carlin came up on stage he asked, \"Who are all those people staring in the windows?\" The host told him the fire marshal had locked them out.\n\n\n\nCarlin thought for a moment then asked, \"How many people are allowed to be on stage?\" The legal limit was 50. The comedian turned to the audience and said, \"Forty of you people in the first few rows come up on stage and give those people outside your seats.\" My friend and I ran up on stage and we all gathered in a circle around him, like at a campfire. For the next 90 minutes, Carlin did his entire act by taking our requests, \"Hippy Dippy Weatherman,\" \"Seven Words ...\"\n\n\n\nAfter the show was over, he passed through our little circle, shaking hands (including mine) as he quickly made his way off stage to avoid being swamped by fans. It was one of my most memorable experiences and a grand gesture for the 40 fans who had been locked out.\n\n\n\nAlexis Karlin of Boston, Massachusetts: When I was little my dad had this box car and one day he put a George Carlin tape in it and it got stuck. So for a year until the car died we listened to this George Carlin tape over and over and over again. ...\n\n\n\nI won't miss that car but I will miss George Carlin.\n\n\n\nChris Sargent of Laurel, Maryland: Last night, the world's greatest comedian and champion of the First Amendment, George Carlin, died at the age of 71 from heart failure. He was one of the few things my father and I had in common, as I have fond memories of sitting in the living room with him, watching George on HBO, and laughing our a***s off.\n\n\n\nHis gift was to make us think about everything.

{"text": "INDIO, California (CNN) -- Parents danced with their young children to the infectious hip-hop beat of Lupe Fiasco on the main stage.\n\n\n\nThe Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Karen O is immersed in the music at Coachella.\n\n\n\nTwentysomethings wearing feathers in their hair jumped up and down to Somali emcee K'naan in the Gobi tent.\n\n\n\nIn the portable toilets, an impromptu discussion broke out about the \"awesomeness\" of Yeah Yeah Yeahs singer Karen O.\n\n\n\nThe mercury may have hovered close to 100 degrees, and somewhere outside the desert oasis of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival there was a global recession, but you'd never know it from the carefree crowd on Day 3 at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California.\n\n\n\nAlthough exact figures have yet to be released, about 50,000 revelers turned out for the final day of the 2009 festival for an eclectic lineup that included former Jam front man Paul Weller, rap pioneers Public Enemy, a reunion of Irish indie darlings My Bloody Valentine and a nearly three-hour set from The Cure.\n\n\n\nPromoters say the turnout exceeded expectations, and this year's attendance figure might be the third largest in the festival's 10-year history. The three-day ticket price may have been steep -- roughly $300, including service charges -- but when divided among the 131 acts on the bill, that breaks down to less than $2.50 per act.\n\n\n\nThis was also the first year concert promoter Goldenvoice offered layaway, which is how 18 percent chose to pay. The strong showing is good news for Bonnaroo, All Points West, Lollapalooza and other festivals taking place this spring and summer. Coachella was also moved up one weekend, which allowed for more kids on spring break to attend.\n\n\n\nAlthough Coachella is one of several music festivals in the United States, it still carries a certain cachet that's hard to match. Perhaps it's the scenery -- listening to music on a grassy polo field surrounded by swaying palm trees and craggy desert mountains. Or maybe it's the thrill of discovering new artists and rediscovering old ones standing shoulder-to-shoulder with friends, strangers and the random Hollywood celebrity.\n\n\n\nOr maybe it's the wacky moments that seem to happen only under the blistering desert sun.\n\n\n\nWhere else could you get Morrissey -- a well-known vegetarian -- complaining in the middle of his Friday set that the smell of burning animals was making him sick, and that he only hoped it was human? The Moz was referring to meat grilling in a food booth across the polo field.\n\n\n\nAnd when troubled British neo-soul singer Amy Winehouse dropped out of her Saturday performance because she couldn't get a visa, M.I.A. stepped into her slot on the main stage -- but she apparently wasn't happy about the upgrade. Despite a massive, adoring crowd and a highly charged set, the new mom exclaimed, \"This is the main stage? Next time, I'm back in a tent! I prefer the sweat!\"\n\n\n\nThis was after her tongue-in-cheek nod to Winehouse, where she sang, \"They tried to make me do the Oscars, I said, 'No, no, no.' \"\n\n\n\nThen, there were the memorable music moments. Friday headliner Sir Paul McCartney didn't end his playful, hit-filled set until about 54 minutes past the midnight curfew -- for a potential fine of $54,000. (According to Benjamin Guitron, media relations officer for the Indio Police Department, the promoter agrees to pay $1,000 for every minute past 12 a.m.)\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, Seattle, Washington, indie pop band Fleet Foxes drew an overflowing crowd to the Outdoor Theatre, charming the audience with its delicate, baroque harmonies. Sunday headliners The Cure played 31 songs from the group's vast catalog -- concentrating heavily on early material, and for the most part, staying away from the biggest radio hits. They, too, played well past curfew -- continuing with their third encore even after the sound from the main PA system was cut off.\n\n\n\nMy Bloody Valentine -- whose four members reunited last year after a decade apart -- was also a crowd pleaser, although an interlude where they played a single chord at maximum decibels for a mind-numbing 15 minutes left fans scratching their heads.\n\n\n\nPerry Farrell is the only artist who's performed at all 10 Coachella festivals -- in Jane's Addiction, Porno for Pyros, Satellite Party, as his alter ego DJ Peretz and in other incarnations. This year, he dueted with Thievery Corporation on the main stage, then headed over to the dance tent, where he joined his wife, Etty, for an electronic set.\n\n\n\n\"I would probably silently be very depressed if they wouldn't invite me, to tell you the truth. My mental health depends on them,\" he said with a laugh.\n\n\n\nDespite a time of belt-tightening, festivalgoers are finding a way to let it all hang out. According to The Desert Sun, the local newspaper, even two former first daughters couldn't resist the draw of the desert. It said Barbara Bush and Jenna Bush Hager dropped into Coachella on Saturday -- complete with Secret Service.\n\n\n\nGuitron couldn't confirm the report, but he did say, \"I wouldn't be surprised if they did show up. Dignitaries just kind of show up like everybody else.\"", "qa": [{"question": "Which vegetarian is mentioned?", "answers": ["Morrissey"]}, {"question": "What is cut off?", "answers": ["PA system", "sound from the main PA system"]}, {"question": "Who ran past curfew?", "answers": ["Paul McCartney", "Sir Paul McCartney"]}, {"question": "Which music festival will wrap up Sunday?", "answers": ["Coachella."]}, {"question": "When does Coachella wrap up?", "answers": ["Day 3"]}, {"question": "What did Morrissey complain about?", "answers": ["the smell of burning animals was making him sick,", "smell of burning animals"]}]}
{"text": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Hugh Masekela is the legendary South African musician whose songs were an inspiration in the fight to end apartheid. He tells CNN about growing up under apartheid, why he left South Africa and what is was like to move back to Johannesburg after 30 years away.\n\n\n\nHugh Masekela: \"The people of South Africa deserve entertainment, recreation and freedom.\"\n\n\n\nCNN: How did the suffering of the apartheid influence your art?\n\n\n\nHugh Masekela: I don't think what I do is influenced by suffering. I come from a talented people who are prolific in music and dance. We have wonderful singers and we have a diversity of music here that is just amazing.\n\n\n\nBut in spite of being oppressed these people were very resilient and they were mostly resilient through song. I think we are the only society where music played such a major part in our resistance.\n\n\n\nWe grew up in rallies and in the street. We didn't have televisions so we played in the streets and made up songs about what was happening.\n\n\n\nWatch Hugh Masekela take CNN on a tour of Johannesburg \u00bb.\n\n\n\nCNN: What's your earliest memory of Johannesburg?\n\n\n\nHM: I came to Jo' burg from Springs [a town near Johannesburg]. My family moved to Alexandra township and the first time I went to town alone I must have been 10 or 11. Jo' burg used to be scrubbed every night with fire hoses and those hard brooms and the granite on the sidewalks would always sparkle. I remember that because I came from Alexander township where there were no lights, no sewage and no cafes.\n\n\n\nThe most vivid memory I have -- we used to stop and look through restaurant windows at the white people eating fancy food, and we'd say \"what do you think that is?\" and \"there are so many types of food!\"\n\n\n\nCNN: How did it feel to leave South Africa?\n\n\n\nHM: When I left South Africa in 1960 I was 20 years old. I wanted to try to get an education and music education was not available for me in South Africa. I wanted to learn from the same kind of teachers that taught Miles Davis and Clifford Brown and Chad Baker and they were not in South Africa. I hoped that one day I could go and learn some of those things and then come back and teach.\n\n\n\nIt was a rough time, when the apartheid government first started showing that if you don't behave, they'll shoot you -- women and children too. You saw police with guns, with machine guns, and for the first time you saw tanks.\n\n\n\nWe had a group called the Jazz Epistles and we were about to take off on a national tour. We were the first African group to play on an LP, but gatherings of more than 10 people were banned so we couldn't do our tour.\n\n\n\nBut four years later, when I was ready to come back to South Africa, I couldn't. The place was impenetrable. By then Mandela had been sentenced to life imprisonment. So I stayed 26 years longer than I planned to.\n\n\n\nSee Hugh Masekela's Johannesburg \u00bb\n\n\n\nCNN: Tell us about coming home.\n\n\n\nHM: It was great, but it was also a tense time coming back to South Africa and we were not naive about it. It was a time of real turmoil. There were no-go places in the townships, there was sniping, there were major clashes and it was a time when civil war was threatening.\n\n\n\nWhen I left South Africa there were 10 million people -- when I came back there were more than 40 million. I had to learn how to get to the highways because when I left where there were no highways. And I had to adjust my language because people would say \"we don't' talk like that anymore!\" I was like a sponge trying to learn to do the right things.\n\n\n\nNot many people came back from exile compared with those who left. About a million left -- 50,000 came back, and of those about 25,000 did a U-turn because it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy but it's been a great experience.\n\n\n\nCNN: How would you define the culture of Jo' burg?\n\n\n\nHM: There's no one culture -- it's a cosmopolitan city. It's so diverse, like South Africa itself has so many diverse cultures.\n\n\n\nBut again, we are still living in the culture of ethnic grouping. If we could beat that and have a major festival of tolerance, it would be the shining path.\n\n\n\nCNN: Where do you like to go out in Jo' burg?\n\n\n\nHM: I go to Newtown, I go to the Market Theater a lot, and also to the Dance Forum, because we have very brilliant dance choreographers. Old Jo' burg was vibrant, there were things going on all the time -- concerts, festivals, clubs -- but in the last 10 years or so it has become a very quiet city at night.\n\n\n\nCNN: What is life like in the city?\n\n\n\nHM: It's not very easy to enjoy the city because the safety and security is not such that you can just go anywhere any time. There's a sadness about this city that everybody talks about.\n\n\n\nPeople in South Africa have become inward; they spend most of the time in their homes. When it gets dark, everyone wants to go home as quickly as they can. That is not only Jo' burg's problem, it is a national problem.\n\n\n\nWhat we're talking about doesn't make me very popular with the people who run this country, but it's nothing new -- you see it in the newspapers every day.\n\n\n\nIt has to be fixed, because the people of South Africa deserve entertainment, recreation and freedom to enjoy the beauty of their country and to show guests around and say \"this is my country.\"", "qa": [{"question": "He couldn't return because of what?", "answers": ["The place was impenetrable."]}, {"question": "What makes Johannesburg and South Africa so cosmopolitan?", "answers": ["It's", "many diverse cultures.", "diverse,"]}, {"question": "Who is Hugh Masekela?", "answers": ["South African musician"]}, {"question": "Who's songs were the inspiration?", "answers": ["Hugh Masekela"]}, {"question": "Where is Johannesburg?", "answers": ["South Africa"]}, {"question": "What was the inspiration?", "answers": ["is the legendary South African musician", "Hugh Masekela", "South African musician whose songs", "Hugh Masekela:", "in the fight to end apartheid."]}]}

Most of the outages -- 34,000 -- were in Collier County, where Fay came ashore earlier in the day.\n\n\n\nAs many as 9,700 residents in Brevard County were without power Tuesday evening, according to David Waters, the county Emergency Operations Center spokesman.\n\n\n\nA Brevard County tornado that hit about 1:45 p.m. damaged more than 50 homes, leaving nine uninhabitable, according to the emergency operations center. Three people suffered minor injuries, officials said.\n\n\n\nFay's maximum sustained winds remained near 65 mph, with higher gusts, forecasters said. A storm tracker in Moore Haven, near the west bank of Lake Okeechobee, reported winds up to 81 mph in the afternoon.\n\n\n\n\"Some fluctuations in intensity are likely this afternoon and tonight as Fay moves inland over Florida.

{"text": "Sara, 29, has lived in Miami for five years, where she works as freelance writer and film maker. Her blog, All Purpose Dark, keeps tabs on the city's nightlife and restaurants, and she is also the editor of the Miami edition of UrbanDaddy.com.\n\nSara has lived in Miami for five years and says the city has a vibrant arts scene.\n\nCNN: What made you start blogging the city?\n\nSara: When I moved down here I realized there was so much more to the city than just the beach and the hotels.\n\nThere were lots of extravagant condo-building parties at the time -- the type where you'd go to the construction site, because the building was still in the planning stages, and they'd throw this lavish catered party with open bar and feather dancers in an effort to get people to buy units. We were going to at least three of these events a week and I felt the need to document it.\n\nSo my blog started out as kind of a nightlife, event-driven blog and eventually became a chronicle of my adventures in the city, focused now mostly on my eating adventures.\n\nCNN: What makes Miami so special to you?\n\nSara: I think Miami is a place of unbridled optimism. It's also a place of great opportunity. There's lots of room here for entrepreneurial spirit and it's very much encouraged and appreciated. Just look at how much the city has changed in five years, in terms of the revival of Downtown and the Design District, and the thriving art scene. It's a place that is still evolving identity-wise and I'm excited to be a part of it.\n\nCNN: Is there anything you dislike about the city?\n\nSara: The seasonal aspect of the city can be frustrating -- the way it shuts down in the summer and then revs up in the winter.\n\nAlso, the crowding in the winter, when all the seasonal residents come back and suddenly there are no parking spaces, the lines at the grocery store are horrendous and you realize you're trying to live in a tourist Mecca and get your errands done when everyone around you is vacationing. Oh and the drivers -- possibly the worst driving etiquette in the country.\n\nCNN: Is Miami just about the sun and sand, or is there more to it?\n\nSara: There's definitely more to this city than the tropical getaway. There's a vibrant art scene, where each month the gallery district is alive with opening receptions and throngs of people interested in getting out and seeing the scene. There's also the internationally renowned Art Basel art fair that comes to town every year putting Miami on the cultural map.\n\nAlso, food-wise there's lots of exciting things going on, from an incredibly diverse selection of Latin cuisine. Everything from Argentinean to Venezuelan food, to Haitian, to Caribbean -- there's a ton of great ethnic food here. There's also a growing high-end dining scene, where a lot of the national trends, like organic, locally sourced cooking, are happening on a very high level.\n\nCNN: Could you describe a typical Miamian's weekend?\n\nSara: A typical weekend would probably entail going to dinner in the Design District on Friday night, going for a walk or a bike ride along the beach on Saturday morning, then lunch on Lincoln Road. Saturday night there are usually some great DJs in town, so it's worth checking out the Downtown club scene, or if it's Art Walk, the galleries in Wynwood.\n\nSunday is spent perusing farmers markets, which are popping up in most neighborhoods, and lazily reading the paper over brunch. Sunday night is always bingo at the Standard hotel, a hipster hangout.\n\nCNN: Where do you shop?\n\nSara: I usually head to the Aventura Mall if I'm looking to hit a bunch of stores in one fix. There's Bloomingdales, Urban Outfitters and your typical mall stores, like Banana Republic, etc. Collins Avenue in South Beach between 10th and 6th is good for Barney's Co-op (where there's always a sale), Intermix and the Webster.\n\nCNN: If Miami was a person, what would she or he be like?\n\nSara: Attractive, laid back and stylish.

{"text": "(CNN)  -- The man arrested for the videotaped rape of a toddler in Las Vegas, Nevada, will make his initial appearance in court Friday, a Clark County, Nevada, court official told CNN Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities have not yet decided if Chester Arthur Stiles will appear in person or via video link. The judge will set a date for the arraignment at that hearing.\n\nStiles, 37, was taken into custody Monday night after a Henderson, Nevada, police officer pulled over the white Buick Century he was driving.\n\nA former girlfriend of Stiles' said that, before the arrest, she lived in fear after going to police to identify the suspect after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news.\n\n\"I've had my share of nightmares,\" Elaine Thomas told CNN's Nancy Grace.\n\nThomas said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television and had no choice but to contact police about the man she had thought was a \"weapons enthusiast\" with only a minor criminal record.  Watch Thomas say how she felt when she saw the photos \u00bb\n\n\"How could I not tell them who that man was? That little girl suffered unimaginable things, and I knew for a fact it was him,\" Thomas said.\n\nThe judge in the case will hold an administrative hearing Wednesday, but Stiles will not be present, Clark County court spokesman Michael Sommermeyer said.\n\nStiles was already being sought on an unrelated 2004 charge of felony lewdness with a child under 14, Sommermeyer said, adding that authorities amended that earlier filing on October 4 to include 20 counts related to the videotaped rape, including sexual assault and attempted sexual assault.\n\nJerry T. Donohue, the attorney for the girl's mother, told CNN that the child on the videotape was younger than 3 when the abuse occurred.\n\nHenderson Police Officer Mike Dye said he pulled over Stiles' car Monday night because it did not have a license plate and became suspicious when the driver gave him an expired California driver's license with a photo that did not look like him.\n\nDye said he and another officer, Mike Gower, questioned Stiles until he admitted his identity.\n\n\"He finally told us, 'Hey, I'm Chester Stiles. I'm the guy you're looking for,'\" Dye said. \"At that time, he said, 'I'm sick of running.'\"\n\nDye said Stiles was calm and cooperative.\n\nStiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was turned over to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police and booked into the jail in Clark County, where he had been sought in connection with the videotape, which shows a girl being sexually assaulted.\n\nThe girl, who is now 7, was found last month after a nationwide search.\n\nThe tape was given to authorities by Darren Tuck, who told police he had found it in the desert five months before handing it over. Because of the delay, during which Tuck allegedly showed the tape to others, he faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography.\n\nHe turned himself in to authorities in Nye County, Nevada, earlier this month.\n\nProfessionals have evaluated the girl in the videotape since she was found, and she appears to be \"healthy and fine and happy,\" her mother's attorney said this month.\n\nThe mother had not known her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until late last month, Donohue said.\n\n\"A family friend called her and said, 'My God, you need to turn on the TV.

But on that fateful morning, she told her daughter she couldn't go with her. As Neda prepared to leave, the mother told CNN last November, she was filled with anxiety. \"I told her to be very careful, and she said she would.\"\n\n\n\nOn June 20, Neda, 26, headed to Tehran's Nilofar Square, where thousands of protesters gathered. Tear gas was lobbed at the crowd. Her eyes burning, Neda headed to a medical clinic to get them washed. Neda later walked toward her car, parked on a side street not far from the heated protests. A single bullet struck her chest, and Neda was dead.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Long Island University announced it was awarding a 2009 George Polk Award, one of journalism's highest honors, to the unknown videographer who captured Neda's final moments -- her collapse on the street and her death. The New York Times reports that this is the first time in the 61-year history of the prestigious awards that judges have given the honor to work done anonymously.\n\n\n\n\"This video footage was seen by millions and became an iconic image of the Iranian resistance,\" John Darnton, curator of the Polk Awards, told the newspaper. \"We don't know who took it or who uploaded it, but we do know it has news value.

On Monday, the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in Dallas released never-before-seen, 8 mm amateur color film taken by Warren.\n\n\n\nAccording to a release by museum curator Gary Mack, Warren was 15 at the time of the assassination, and because students were given the day off for the president's visit, he took his camera to Love Field to watch the arrival of Air Force One.\n\n\n\n\"My dad operated a furniture store adjacent to the airport, and so that morning on his way to work, he dropped me off at the airport to see [President Kennedy] come in,\" Warren said, according to the museum release. \"It was cool and yet the sun was shining bright, and there was lots of excitement.\"\n\n\n\nKennedy was killed less than an hour after Warren captured the start of his visit to Texas.

She ultimately interviewed more than 500 people, blogged regularly and posted 370 videos.\n\n\n\nIn January, she launched the Journey Institute, telling CNN on Monday, \"One main thing I heard while traveling was, if they didn't have someone to push them or mentor them or train them, they wouldn't have been able to put their idea into action.\"\n\n\n\nSo after her journey, Michaelson decided to help people get their ideas off the couch and put them into action. Her plan is to bring people from every state facing similar challenges to Denver and give them training on how to solve those problems.\n\n\n\nMichaelson said, \"No matter where I went, I met people who were the same as the pioneers who built this country. They not only had to build their barns and plant their fields, they had to help their neighbors do the same.

His official biography declares it was at the foothills of Mount Baekdu, North Korea's sacred mountain, amid bright lights and double rainbows. But historians are pretty sure he was born at a guerrilla base under Soviet protection in the Soviet Union. The discrepancy should not surprise. When Time magazine's Frances Romero wrote about the supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the profile began, \"An easy way of summing up Kim's life in one sentence would be to throw in the words reportedly, allegedly and the occasional is said to.\"\n\n\n\nHis father, Kim Il Sung, founded North Korea, and his son ran the country more or less for 20 years as his father aged, taking power officially in 1997, a few years after his father's death. \"Here's a guy who is very concerned about his physical stature, among other things,\" said Dr. Jerrold Post, a former CIA psychologist who heads the political psychology program at George Washington University. \"He's 5-foot-2 and wears 4-inch lifts in his shoes.\"\n\n\n\nPost, in his book \"Leaders and Their Followers in a Dangerous World,\" writes that Kim also loved to drink a certain Hennessy cognac that sold for $630 a bottle in Korea. Hennessy, the maker of Paradis cognac, confirmed that Kim was the biggest buyer of the cognac, and between 1988 and 1998, maintained an estimated annual account of $650,000 to $800,000.\n\n\n\nPost wrote the ruler \"annually spent 770 times the income of the average North Korean citizen ($1,038) on cognac alone!\" Post told CNN that Kim Jong Il once kidnapped the most prominent South Korean movie star and kept her under house arrest with her husband for eight years. And he has a collection of some 20,000 videotapes, including the complete James Bond movie collection.\n\n\n\nIn August 2008, Kim had a stroke and was out of view for some time, and now seems to have recovered.

{"text": "(CNN) -- In the three years since \"Twilight\" bowed in theaters, we've learned a few things:\n\n\n\n\n\nOne, while teen girls are a sizable portion of the fan base, they're not its totality.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo, the first three films of the franchise have pulled in roughly $1.8 billion worldwide in ticket sales (not adjusted for inflation), according to BoxOfficeMojo.com. That's apparently enough for Robert Pattinson, who stars as Edward Cullen, to talk of being able to afford to fail, and his co-star Kristen Stewart (Bella Swan) of donating some of her \"funds.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThree, there must be a just a teeny tiny footnote on each installment's budget for Taylor Lautner's wardrobe, because rare is the moment when the kid isn't walking around without a shirt.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as \"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part I\" opens in theaters today, we're recounting 10 other (tongue firmly in cheek) lessons we've culled from the series, themes that have been carried from Stephenie Meyer's best-selling novels onto the big screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Love at first sight is overrated; he or she should fall for you at first whiff.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Edward Cullen got to know the human he eventually married, he smelled Bella from across the classroom.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, his senses are attuned to the scent of human blood, but you're missing the point: Bella's smelled special, like his \"own personal brand of heroin,\" as he memorably says in the first film. Ladies and gents, rethink your relationships if they don't inspire comparisons to narcotics.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. \"He's Just Not That Into You\" had it all wrong -- silence, irritation, storming off and mood swings are actually signs of unexpressed affection.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdward Cullen wasn't always the sparkly dreamboat of a blood-drinking gentleman you'll see in theaters this weekend. At first, he was actually pretty rude, prone to angrily walking away from Bella, being short with her and repeatedly telling her to stay away from him because he's dangerous. Talk about mixed messages!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next time someone gives you the brush off, don't think he or she isn't into you. Perhaps they're just trying to refrain from going for that vein in your neck.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to our next lesson:\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Be accepting of your partner's eccentricities.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuirks such as eye color fluctuations, superhuman strength, the ability to read minds and family members who try to devour you on your birthday are qualities that make a partner unique. Don't let silly things like her predisposition to kill stand in the way -- every relationship has its obstacles! Just be glad she's not a zombie.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. There's no such thing as personal space when one's in love.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdward and Bella are so into each other, the thought of being separated for more than a span of a few days could send one of them into an outburst that rivals a demonic possession out of \"The Exorcist.\" This was depicted with strong commitment from Kristen Stewart in 2008's \"Twilight,\" as she made Bella appear to be on the verge of a stroke when Edward suggested they should maybe rethink this whole human/vampire relationship thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nReally, your partner only needs enough space to go to the bathroom and change clothes, and even then, you should be waiting for them on the other side of the door.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. In the event that you and your partner do breakup, withdrawing from life as you lived it while having hallucinations about your romantic partner are all expected side effects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's why they call it being lovesick, kids.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Since you can't control such emotions, one should be open to falling in love with a human, shapeshifter, immortal or a baby.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaylor Lautner's Jacob Black and other select members of his tribe have the ability to phase into wolves to protect their land, and they can also \"imprint,\" essentially falling in love and linking themselves with the one person with whom they're supposed to be . They also can't help whom they \"imprint\" on.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if it happens that the woman of your dreams was born just a few days ago to the woman you used to have a crush on, well, you'll just have to wait.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. If one love interest is the fun one, and the other love interest brings the passion, just hang out with both for as long as possible. *\n\n\n\n\n\nCommitting to one person is a tough choice, especially when you could die just from hanging around said individual, so it's understandable if your affections get pulled in another direction during a vulnerable moment. The best thing to do is to maintain one as the \"relationship\" and the other as the \"friendship\" until you can't play that game anymore. Bonus if they're natural-born enemies.\n\n\n\n\n\n* Frankly, this lesson makes some sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. There's always going to be a rumble brewing, and one of you is always going to have to be saved.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdward and Bella are always fighting off this enemy or that, right up until the very end. Believe it or not, this kind of stress somehow benefits the relationship -- just think of all that drama as the\"spark\" that ignites the fire of romantic moments. You know, \"It's us against the world/Volturi,\" etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n9. When given the option, go ahead and stay human for the honeymoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you're not breaking the bed while vacationing on your new spouse's private island, you're doing it wrong. Thankfully, there's hired help ready to clean it all up for you -- that's what happens when you wed an unbelievably wealthy immortal. But if you get pregnant, get ready for one hellish gestation period.\n\n\n\n\n\n10. One can both acknowledge the ridiculousness of lessons one through nine and still be in line for a midnight showing after reading the series (again).\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the biggest lesson of all? Don't look for nuggets of enlightenment in \"Twilight.\" As fans of the series could tell you, the biggest draw isn't the outlandish plot points or the unrealistic romantic ideals, but the classic fantasy of love somehow conquering all.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave we missed a lesson you've learned? We want to hear it in the comments.", "qa": [{"question": "Who stars in the movie?", "answers": ["Robert Pattinson,"]}, {"question": "What opens in theaters?", "answers": ["Part I\"", "\"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn", "\"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part I\""]}]}

{"text": "(CNN) -- U.S. President George W. Bush on Tuesday will designate nine sites in three areas of the central Pacific as marine national monuments, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new designated areas make up the largest area of ocean set aside for marine conservation in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new areas make up the largest area of ocean set aside for marine conservation in the world -- 195,280 square miles -- and, coupled with a 138,000-square mile designation in Hawaii two years go, mean that Bush will have protected more of the ocean than any other president.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The president's actions will prevent the destruction and extraction of natural resources from these beautiful and biologically diverse areas without conflicting with our military's activities and freedom of navigation, which are vital to our national security,\" Perino said. \"And the public and future generations will benefit from the science and knowledge gained from these areas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBush is using the 1906 Antiquities Act -- first used by President Theodore Roosevelt to set aside public lands such as the Grand Canyon as national monuments -- for the designation. Many of those lands later became national parks.\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Chandler, vice president for government affairs for the non-profit Marine Conservation Biology Institute (MCBI), said Bush is \"to be commended\" for his action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From a conservation history perspective, the message here is that Teddy Roosevelt laid the groundwork for our national park system when he withdrew a lot of public lands and called them national monuments,\" said Chandler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We see the president laying the foundation for a system of national marine preserves and parks,\" he said. \"We had lacked such a system for a long time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMCBI and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) partnered to identify eight of the nine sites the president will set aside on Tuesday. All but one of those eight remote areas already have Fish and Wildlife Service refuge areas at their cores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You have a core conservation mission already,\" Chandler said. \"This is just basically going to expand them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MCBI/EDF-identified sites are Rose Atoll, Wake Island, Johnston Island, Palmyra Island, Kingman Reef, Baker Island, Howland Island and Jarvis Island.\n\n\n\n\n\nRose Atoll, part of American Samoa, is the smallest atoll in the world, but more than 500 fish species swim in the waters around it, and it supports 97 percent of America Samoa's seabird population. It is also the nesting ground for several threatened turtle species.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pew Environmental Fund identified the ninth site -- the waters around the northern Marianas and the deepest ocean canyon in the world, the Mariana Trench, 11,033 meters (36,201 feet) at its deepest.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new designations will expand protection to a 50 nautical mile area off the islands, where commercial fishing will be prohibited. Other uses of the area -- research or recreational fishing -- will be allowed but will require a permit.\n\n\n\n\n\nBush has not gotten rave reviews for his conservation efforts on land -- according to the Audubon Society, he's signed wilderness legislation covering a little more than 2 million acres, fewer than any other president except Richard Nixon. But Chandler said that Bush \"has really embraced ocean conservation as his own.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ocean protection ... is lagging 50 to 100 years behind land conservation, he said. \"This is precisely the kind of leadership that we need to get the message across that there are places in the ocean that are rich with diversity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Scientists already know this,\" he said. \"They have been calling for this for 10 or 15 years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president can cut through the bureaucracy that makes protecting resources such a lengthy process, and the Antiquities Act is a strong tool for those efforts. With the Act, the president can make a designation by executive order, essentially \"writing the prescription for conservation\" for an area, Chandler said.", "qa": [{"question": "The new areas cover how many square miles?", "answers": ["195,280"]}, {"question": "What did the sites include?", "answers": ["Rose Atoll, Wake Island, Johnston Island, Palmyra Island, Kingman Reef, Baker Island, Howland Island and Jarvis Island."]}, {"question": "How many nautical miles will be protected?", "answers": ["50"]}, {"question": "What did Bush designate?", "answers": ["Pacific as marine national monuments,", "nine sites in three areas of the central"]}, {"question": "Who designated the marine national monuments?", "answers": ["President George W.

{"text": "(CNN) -- A lawyer who left a videotape saying Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom would be responsible if anything happened to him masterminded his own death last year, a special United Nations commission said Tuesday after an eight-month investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nColom had nothing to do with the killing, said Carlos Castresana, head of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rodrigo Rosenberg, for some reason, decided to put an end to his life,\" Castresana said at a televised news conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nRosenberg was shot from behind in a brazen daylight attack while riding his bicycle in Guatemala City, the nation's capital. He was shot three times in the head, once in the neck and once in the back, Castresana said.\n\n\n\n\n\nProminent Guatemalan brothers Francisco Jose Valdez Paiz and Jose Estuardo Valdez Paiz hired hit men at the behest of Rosenberg, who told them he was being threatened by someone, Castresana said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two brothers, who own a pharmaceutical company, had been cousins of Rosenberg through a previous marriage and did not know that he was the target of the assassination, Castresana said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRosenberg fed information to the hit squad leader that led to his own death, giving descriptions of what the target looked like and where he would be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was the two brothers and no one else,\" Castresana said. \"Not a politician. Not a [government] minister. Not a police chief. No one. Just these two brothers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 300 investigators from 11 nations reached their conclusion after an exhaustive examination of 100,000 telephone calls, 9,500 documents, surveillance videotapes, and 135 interviews with 11 suspects and others, Castresana said.\n\n\n\n\n\nColom had maintained since the May 10 slaying that he was innocent despite Rosenberg's explosive videotape, which was made public the day after his death.\n\n\n\n\n\nGuatemalan authorities have arrested 11 men on suspicion that they carried out the killing, but the Valdez Paiz brothers remain at large.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir lawyer, Alexis Calderon, denied last week that his clients were involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a story being made up to implicate people who didn't have anything to do with it,\" Calderon said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also said that he did not know where the brothers were but that they would surrender after Tuesday's conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalderon did not answer calls seeking comment Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nArrest warrants for the brothers were issued December 10, Castresana said, noting that the suspects were already out of the country by then.\n\n\n\n\n\nRosenberg recorded the tape blaming Colom three days before his death.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said Colom wanted him dead because the lawyer had been blaming the president and some of his top associates for the slaying of a prominent businessman and his daughter the previous month.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusinessman Khalid Musa and his daughter, Marjorie, were killed, Rosenberg said, because they had refused to participate in acts of corruption as the president wanted.\n\n\n\n\n\nRosenberg was Musa's attorney.\n\n\n\n\n\nCastresana indicated Rosenberg staged his own killing to get back at Colom and high-level members of his government, whom he could not prove were responsible for the Musa killings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He wanted to open a box of lightning and thunder,\" said Castresana, a Spanish judge.\n\n\n\n\n\nCastresana pointed to several indicators of Rosenberg's state of mind: His mother had died; he was going through a second divorce, and his wife had taken their young children to Mexico; he was bereft at the slaying of Marjorie Musa, with whom he had a close relationship; and he felt a sense of powerlessness because he could not prosecute the people he believed were responsible for the Musa slayings.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 10, the date of his killing, was Mother's Day.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn two April 21 e-mails, seven days after the Musa killings, Rosenberg wrote, \"I can't stop crying\" and \"I feel like I'm disintegrating,\" Castresana said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRosenberg made out his last will and testament on April 24 and started going public with his accusations against Colom regarding the Musa slayings on May 3.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn May 4, he called a meeting at his law office and said he would be leaving the firm, in which he was a partner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next day, Castresana said, Rosenberg asked a friend to buy two cell phones anonymously. Those cell phones, the lead investigator said, were crucial to cracking the case.\n\n\n\n\n\nRosenberg used one of the phones to call threats to his personal cell phone and had the other delivered to the Valdez Paiz brothers, who gave it to the hit squad leader. Rosenberg then used the new cell phone he kept to give instructions to the hit squad leader through the second phone, Castresana said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCastresana detailed how the slaying apparently was meant to be paid through a $40,000 check.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the investigator, Rosenberg told his secretary before his death that she would be receiving a check from Panama that should be delivered to the Valdez Paiz brothers. The check had been made out by Luis Alejos, a Rosenberg friend and business associate who at the time was Guatemala's minister of communication, Castresana said. Alejos resigned from office in June, a few weeks after the slaying.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter receiving the check, Francisco Jose Valdez Paiz destroyed it, Castresana said. The businessman paid the 300,000 quetzales ($35,900) for the assassination out of his own pocket, Castresana said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investigator said Rosenberg sent Alejos the money to pay for the killing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlejos is the brother of Roberto Alejos, the president of the Guatemalan Congress, and a cousin of Gustavo Alejos, who is President Colom's private secretary.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his videotape, Rosenberg said Gustavo Alejos would be among those responsible for the lawyer's death if it happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you are reading this message, it means that I, Rodrigo Rosenberg Marzano, was murdered by the president's private secretary, Gustavo Alejos, and his associate Gregorio Valdez, with the approval of Mr. Alvaro Colom and [first lady] Sandra de Colom,\" Rosenberg said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the tape surfaced, Colom went on national TV with a vehement denial that he or anyone mentioned in the video was involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe expressed his sense of vindication in a televised speech Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't have any rancor in my heart,\" Colom said. \"Just immense gratitude for those who waited patiently with us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations established the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala in 2006 to investigate corruption and political violence. More than 200,000 people have been killed in the nation since 1970, mostly as a result of organized crime, drug-trade violence and a 36-year civil war that ended in 1996.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were 6,451 slayings in Guatemala last year, of which only 230 verdicts were achieved, Castresana said. That means, he said, that more than 96 percent of the killings in 2009 were not solved.", "qa": [{"question": "UN   commission included how many investigators?", "answers": ["300"]}, {"question": "What did the lawyer leave?", "answers": ["videotape", "a videotape"]}, {"question": "what did the tape say?", "answers": ["if anything happened to him", "Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom would be responsible", "blaming Colom three days before his death.", "the"]}, {"question": "what is president expressing?", "answers": ["his sense of vindication"]}, {"question": "how many investigators?", "answers": ["300", "About 300"]}, {"question": "How many investigators were there?", "answers": ["About 300"]}, {"question": "UN   commission is from how many nations?", "answers": ["11"]}, {"question": "Who felt vindicated?", "answers": ["Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom", "Colom"]}]}

{"text": "(CNN) -- Perhaps it really WAS destiny.\n\n\"Slumdog Millionaire,\" the little film that overcame tremendous odds simply to earn an American release, won eight Oscars Sunday night at the 81st annual Academy Awards, including best picture.\n\n\"Most of all we had passion and we had belief, and our film shows if you have those two things, you have everything,\" said producer Christian Colson, surrounded by many members of the film's huge cast and crew.\n\nIt was a supremely unlikely success story. \"Millionaire,\" which combines elements of Bollywood melodrama and documentary grit, features no stars.\n\nIt's set largely among the poverty-stricken districts of Mumbai, India, and one-third of the film is in Hindi. Its initially reluctant director, Danny Boyle, is better known for brash British films such as \"Trainspotting\" and \"28 Days Later.\" And the film almost went straight to DVD in America, thanks to the folding of initial studio Warner Independent Pictures (like CNN, it's a unit of Time Warner).\n\nBut the film's orphaned, poverty-raised hero, played by Dev Patel, overcomes his challenges to earn a spot on the game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" -- not necessarily to win money, but to connect with his lost love. On the show, he's told that perhaps he is a figure of destiny.\n\n\"It is written,\" the show's smarmy host tells him, somewhat mockingly, after Patel's character aces several questions. List of winners, nominees\n\n\"Slumdog's\" filmmakers were jubilant at the wins, which also included Oscars for best director (Boyle), best adapted screenplay (Simon Beaufoy), score (A.R. Rahman), cinematography (Anthony Dod Mantle), song, sound mixing and film editing.\n\nBoyle jumped up and down as he accepted his award, saying he'd told his children that if he ever won, he'd bounce like Tigger from \"Winnie-the-Pooh.\"\n\nRahman was equally appreciative.\n\n\"All my life I've had a choice between hate and love, and I chose love, and now I'm here,\" he said.  Gallery: See what the stars are wearing \u00bb\n\n\"Slumdog's\" main competition, \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\" won just three Oscars, all in minor categories. The film had led the pack with 13 nominations.\n\nThe rest of the Oscar broadcast alternated between host Hugh Jackman's smooth song-and-dance numbers, some comic moments from Steve Martin, Tina Fey and Ben Stiller, and politics, generally focused on gay rights and California's anti-gay marriage Proposition 8.\n\nSean Penn won best actor for playing Harvey Milk in \"Milk,\" the story of the first openly gay man elected to major public office. Penn earned laughs and applause for his speech. iReport.com: What do you think of the winners?\n\n\"You commie homo-loving sons of guns,\" the sometimes truculent actor began, to laughter. \"I did not expect this, and I wanted to be very clear that I do know how hard I make it to appreciate me, often. But I am touched by the appreciation.\"\n\nAfter a series of thank-you's, he turned serious in talking about gay marriage. \"For those who saw the signs of hatred as our cars drove in tonight, I think it's a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect on their great shame and their shame in their grandchildren's eyes if they continue that support,\" Penn said. \"We've got to have equal rights for everyone.\"\n\nDustin Lance Black, who won original screenplay for \"Milk,\" also gave an impassioned speech in favor of gay rights.\n\n\"I think [Milk] would want me to say to all the gay and lesbian kids out there tonight ... that you are beautiful, wonderful creatures of value, and that no matter what anyone tells you, God does love you and that very soon, I promise you, you will have equal rights, federally, across this great nation of ours.\"\n\nHeath Ledger won best supporting actor for his performance as the Joker in \"The Dark Knight.\" His parents and sister accepted the award for the actor, who died in January 2008.\n\n\"This award tonight would have humbly validated Heath's quiet determination to be truly accepted by you all here -- his peers -- within an industry he truly loved,\" said Ledger's father, Kim.\n\nLedger is only the second actor to win a posthumous actor. Peter Finch won best actor for 1976's \"Network\" two months after he died in early 1977.\n\nOther winners included Kate Winslet, who won best actress for her performance in \"The Reader\"; Penelope Cruz, who won best supporting actress honor for \"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\"; and \"WALL-E,\" which won best animated feature.\n\nMost of the winners, if not foreordained, were expected. The evening's sole shock came with best foreign-language film, which went to the Japanese film \"Departures.\" Among the films it beat were France's \"The Class\" and Israel's \"Dances With Bashir,\" two of the best-reviewed films of the year.\n\nThe Oscars moved at a steady pace, largely thanks to Jackman's brisk, jokey work. Only the introductions to the four acting categories, in which previous winners read tributes to current nominees as if they were about to appear on \"This Is Your Life,\" considerably slowed the show, which ran close to three and a half hours.\n\nAt various points, Jackman cracked wise about downsizing -- \"Next year,\" said the \"Australia\" star, \"I'll be starring in a movie called 'New Zealand' \" -- performed songs about each best picture nominee in various musical styles, and paid tribute to various celebrities as if pointing out VIPs in a nightclub. He even physically carried Anne Hathaway on stage to play Richard Nixon in a \"Frost/Nixon\" send-up. Blog: Behind the scenes\n\nBut it was \"Slumdog Millionaire\" that carried the evening. At one point, Resul Pookutty, who won for sound mixing, seemed overwhelmed as he accepted his Oscar.\n\n\"I dedicate this award to my country,\" he said. \"Thank you, Academy, this is not just a sound award, this is history being handed over to me.\"\n\nGiven the import of East meeting West, the movie business can say the same thing.", "qa": [{"question": "Who is Heath Ledger?", "answers": ["actor,", "Joker in \"The Dark Knight.\""]}, {"question": "What is the name of the winner for best actor?", "answers": ["Dev Patel,", "Sean Penn"]}, {"question": "Who is Sean Penn?", "answers": ["actor", "won best actor for playing Harvey Milk in \"Milk,\"", "Harvey Milk", "won best actor"]}, {"question": "when Kate Winslet wins best actress for \"The Reader\"?", "answers": ["Sunday night at the 81st annual Academy Awards,"]}, {"question": "who is Kate Winslet?", "answers": ["won best actress for her performance in \"The Reader\";", "actress"]}, {"question": "How many Oscars did the movie win?", "answers": ["eight"]}, {"question": "what \"Slumdog Millionaire\" wins eight Oscars?", "answers": ["Sunday night at the 81st annual Academy Awards, including best picture.", "Sunday night", "Millionaire,\" the little film that overcame tremendous", "the little film", "film", "the", "odds simply to earn an American release, won", "won"]}, {"question": "What is the name of the winner for Best Actress?", "answers": ["Kate Winslet,"]}]}

It hurts the leadership. Indeed, it hurts the government. It hurts the people of Pakistan,\" said Musharraf, speaking from Dallas, Texas, during a book tour in the United States.\n\nThe interview took place amid reports Friday of U.S. drones striking militant targets in Pakistan just days after the start of the Obama administration -- which has made combating al Qaeda and Taliban militants in the Pakistan tribal region near Afghanistan its most immediate national security priority.\n\nMusharraf was asked whether he is comfortable with the continuation of the attacks, even with a new U.S. president in place.\n\n\"Nobody in Pakistan is comfortable with the strikes across the border. There is no doubt in that. Public opinion is very much against it,\" he said. \"But as far as this issue of the new president -- President Obama having taken over and this continuing -- but I have always been saying that policies don't change with personalities; policies have national interest, and policies depend on an environment.\n\n\"So the environment and national interest of the United States being the same, I thought policies will remain constant,\" he said.

Musharraf said the 1989 \"peace dividend\" went to Europe -- East Europe.\n\nPakistan was \"left alone\" from 1989 to 2001, and during that period, the militant Taliban movement took control of Afghanistan.\n\n\"What did Pakistan get out of fighting for 10 years with you?

At age 15, Santos says, he met \"a guy\" at a party who introduced him to drug kingpins in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.\n\n\n\n\"You start off as a driver,\" Santos said. \"People feel like they can trust you, then you move up to something bigger.\"\n\n\n\nTwo weeks later, he got a $4,000 job offer to drive his first load of marijuana across a bridge into El Paso. It was the beginning of a four-year smuggling career.\n\n\n\n\"I can't say I wasn't nervous,\" Santos said. \"You kind of project yourself into another time of happiness or joy. ... You just have to forget you have something illegal in the car.\"\n\n\n\nIn all, Santos says, he earned $50,000 making about 20 mule runs, driving right through heavily guarded border checkpoints.\n\n\n\nSantos, who is now 21, says he was arrested once but spent only a few days in jail. He said charges were dropped. Because he was younger than 18 when he was arrested, and juvenile cases are sealed, CNN could not confirm his story through court records.\n\n\n\nYoung smugglers don't fit a stereotype. Several sources said that both American and Mexican teens are lured into the work. Teenage boys and girls alike are involved. Many smugglers come from middle-class families.\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of money in the trade, a lot of inducement for a lot of young people to get involved,\" El Paso County Attorney Jose Rodriguez said. His office is responsible for prosecuting juvenile smugglers.\n\n\n\nFederal and state authorities say drug cartels recruit young smugglers from schools. Depending on the size of the drug load that's being smuggled, a kid can be paid a couple hundred dollars up to $5,000.\n\n\n\nMexican officials say cartels have placed classified advertisements in Mexican newspapers with cryptic messages offering young people a job with good salary and benefits. A phone number is included in the ad.\n\n\n\nThe officials say a cartel member sets up a meeting to determine whether the kid is up to the job.\n\n\n\nBut Rodriguez offers a chilling reason why teenagers should avoid the lure of easy money.\n\n\n\n\"We had a kid here who lost a load and had some of his toes chopped off,\" Rodriguez said.\n\n\n\nSantos says he got out of the smuggling business two years ago. Now he spends every day training at a boxing gym in El Paso.\n\n\n\nBoxing and smuggling can both be vicious worlds, but at least boxing is legal. However, it's a slow climb to the top of the boxing world.\n\n\n\nHe's chasing the golden dreams of boxing championships and hoping to make more money boxing than he did smuggling.\n\n\n\nSantos is working two part-time jobs, and he says it takes him two months to earn the money that he used to make in one day of drug smuggling. He spent almost all the money he made smuggling. But he has no regrets.\n\n\n\n\"The peace of mind is good,\" Santos said after a bruising workout. \"I sleep good, eat good.

Spokesman Raymond Kerins said that was to \"raise productivity.\"\n\n\n\nBut analysts say Pfizer is clearly trying to beef up its drug pipeline through an acquisition, adding that the company seems to have given up on its own R&D staff coming up with a blockbuster to replace Lipitor. This cholesterol-cutting drug peaked in 2006 with nearly $13 billion in annual sales but will lose its patent protection in 2011, when generic versions will become available.\n\n\n\nLes Funtleyder, pharma analyst for Miller Tabak, said Pfizer is \"not feeling that they're getting the efficiency out of their R&D unit.\" He said Pfizer would probably rather do a deal with Wyeth over other competitors, because there is less overlap in the companies' pipelines.\n\n\n\nFuntleyder said Pfizer already has a diabetes franchise, which would overlap with Eli Lilly & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb, both of which also focus on diabetes treatments. Pfizer probably has its eyes on Wyeth's Alzheimer's drug pipeline, he said. But he cautions that a merger won't be a success unless Wyeth's pipeline is successful, which remains to be seen, he said.\n\n\n\n\"If Wyeth comes out with an Alzheimer's drug that works, then the deal works,\" he said.\n\n\n\nPfizer is probably also focused on Wyeth's blockbuster children's vaccine Prevnar, as well as its experimental biotech drugs, said Michael Krensavage of Krensavage Asset Management.\n\n\n\nSales of Prevnar, which combats meningitis and blood infections, jumped 12 percent in the first nine months of 2008 compared with the same period the prior year, to $2.1 billion.\n\n\n\nIf a deal does go through, Funtleyder warns, Wyeth staffers should brace for layoffs.\n\n\n\n\"I can say with pretty good confidence that this is going to lead to some head count reduction,\" he said.", "qa": [{"question": "What did the rep say?", "answers": ["not to comment on rumor or speculation,\"", "\"It is our policy not to comment on rumor or speculation,\"", "\"I can", "with pretty good confidence that this is going to lead to some head count reduction,\""]}, {"question": "How many jobs are being cut?", "answers": ["800"]}, {"question": "Which department is having staff cut?", "answers": ["Pfizer said it was cutting up to 8 percent of its R&D", "R&D", "cutting up to 8 percent of its R&D"]}, {"question": "What are the rumors about Wyeth?", "answers": ["for $68 billion,", "Pfizer is near a deal to buy rival drugmaker"]}, {"question": "What did Pfizer say?", "answers": ["\"raise productivity.\""]}, {"question": "Who said it's not their policy to comment on rumors?", "answers": ["Michael Lampe, a Wyeth representative."]}, {"question": "Who was not immediately available?", "answers": ["Pfizer"]}, {"question": "What kind of company is Wyeth?", "answers": ["drugmaker"]}, {"question": "What did the Wyeth rep say?", "answers": ["\"It is our policy not to comment on rumor or speculation,\""]}, {"question": "Number of jobs Pfizer was cutting?", "answers": ["800", "about 800", "said it", "up to"]}, {"question": "Who was not available for comment?", "answers": ["Pfizer"]}, {"question": "What would Pfizer be commenting on?", "answers": ["focused", "is probably", "Wyeth's blockbuster children's vaccine Prevnar, as well as its experimental biotech drugs,", "buy rival drugmaker Wyeth", "a deal to buy rival drugmaker Wyeth", "cutting up to 8 percent of its R&D staff,"]}]}
{"text": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Consumer advocates Wednesday hailed the settlement of a class-action lawsuit over Sears stoves in which the retailer agreed to install safety brackets for free to prevent the appliances from tipping over or provide other reimbursements.\n\nStoves in danger of tipping over can be fixed for free under terms of a settlement announced Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the court-approved agreement, Sears will notify nearly 4 million customers who may have bought stoves between July 2000 and September 2007 that they either can get anti-tip safety brackets installed for free or receive gift cards or reimbursements of up to $100 to qualifying customers.\n\nThe brackets keep the appliances bolted to the floor or wall to prevent them from tipping over.

{"text": "(CNN) -- Retired Adm. William Fallon resigned in March as leader of the U.S. military's Central Command after reportedly clashing with President Bush.\n\n\n\nRetired Adm. William Fallon told CNN he resigned to maintain confidence in the military chain of command.\n\n\n\nDuring an interview Tuesday on CNN's American Morning,\" Fallon denied a magazine article's assertion that he had been forced to resign over his opposition to a possible war with Iran.\n\n\n\nCNN's Kyra Phillips asked Fallon about his resignation and about U.S. policy regarding Iraq and Iran.\n\n\n\nKyra Phillips: How were you informed that this was it? Who called you?\n\n\n\nFallon: The story is -- the facts are that the situation was one that was very uncomfortable for me and, I'm sure, for the president. One of the most important things in the military is confidence in the chain of command. And the situation that developed was one of uncertainty and a feeling that maybe that I was disloyal to the president and that I might be trying to countermand his orders, the policies of the country. ... The fact that people might be concerned that I was not appropriately doing what I was supposed to do and following orders bothered me, and my sense was that the right thing to do was to offer my resignation.  Watch Fallon break his silence \u00bb\n\n\n\nPhillips: Do you feel you were pushed out?\n\n\n\nFallon: What was important was not me. It wasn't some discussion about where I was with issues. It was the fact that we have a war in progress. We had a couple of hundred thousand people whose lives were at stake out in Iraq and Afghanistan and we needed to be focused on that and not a discussion on me or what I might have said or thought or someone perceived I said. That's the motivation.\n\n\n\nPhillips: [Esquire magazine writer] Tom Barnett made it appear that you were the only man standing between the president and a war with Iran. Is that true?\n\n\n\nFallon: I don't believe for a second President Bush wants a war with Iran. The situation with Iran is very complex. People sometimes portray it or try to portray it in very simplistic terms -- we're against Iran, we want to go to war with Iran, we want to be close to them. ... The reality is in international politics that [there are] many aspects to many of these situations, and I believe in our relationship with Iran we need to be strong and firm and convey the principles on which this country stands and upon which our policies are based. At the same time demonstrate a willingness and openness to engage in dialogue because there are certainly things we can find in common.\n\n\n\nPhillips: Would have you negotiated with Iran?\n\n\n\nFallon: It's not my position to negotiate with Iran. I was the military commander in the Middle East. I had responsibility for our people and their safety and well-being. It's the role of the diplomats to do the negotiation.\n\n\n\nPhillips: So when talk of the third war came out, a war with Iran, the president didn't say to you, \"This is what I want to do,\" and did you stand up and say, \"No, sir. Bad move\"?\n\n\n\nFallon: It's probably not appropriate to try to characterize it in that way. Again, don't believe for a second that the president really wants to go to war with Iran. We have a lot of things going on, and there are many other ways to solve problems. I was very open and candid in my advice. I'm not shy. I will tell people, the leaders, what I think and offer my opinions on Iran and other things, and continue to do that.\n\n\n\nPhillips: Do you think that cost you your job?\n\n\n\nFallon: No, I don't believe so at all. It's a confidence issue of do people really believe the chain of command is working for them or do we have doubts, and if the doubts focus attention away from what the priority issues ought to be, then we've got to make a change.\n\n\n\nPhillips: We talk about your no-nonsense talk and the fact that you had no problems standing up to the president. Your critics say that Admiral Fallon is a difficult man to get along with. Are you?\n\n\n\nFallon: You probably could ask my wife about that. She would have a few things to say.\n\n\n\nI think that what's really important here is that when I was asked to take this job about a year and a half ago, I believe it was because we were facing some very difficult days in Iraq and Afghanistan and in the region. I had some experience in dealing with international problems. I certainly had a lot of combat experience, and I was brought in in an attempt to make things better. That's what I went about doing.\n\n\n\nAgain, there are things that are important and other things in life that are less so. A lot of the issues that became points of discussion to me were not really important items. The important items were the people, what they're doing, how to get this job done, how to get the war ended and get our people home.\n\n\n\nPhillips: Hillary Clinton [and] Barack Obama talk about pulling troops out by next year. John McCain says, no, we've got to stay the course. What is the best course for Iraq right now?  Watch what the candidates say about war policy \u00bb\n\n\n\nFallon: I believe the best course is to retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus and his team out there. Dave has done a magnificent job in leading our people in that country.\n\n\n\nAgain, this situation is quite complex -- many angles. There's a very, very important military role here in providing stability and security in this country, but that's not going to be successful, as we know, without lots of other people playing a hand.\n\n\n\nThe political side of things in Iraq has got to move forward. That appears to be improving. People have to have confidence in their futures. They want to have stability. They would like to be able to raise their families in peace. They would like to have a job. They would like to look to tomorrow as better than today.\n\n\n\nIt takes more than the military, but the military is essential to provide stability and security. The idea we would walk away from Iraq strikes me as not appropriate. We all want to bring our troops home. We want to have the majority of our people back and we want the war ended.\n\n\n\nGiven where we are today, the progress that they've made particularly in the last couple months, I think it's very, very heartening to see what's really happened here.\n\n\n\nThe right course of action is to continue to work with the Iraqis and let them take over the majority of the tasks for ensuring security for the country and have our people come out on a timetable that's appropriate to conditions on the ground.", "qa": [{"question": "What is the best course in Iraq?", "answers": ["to retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus", "to retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus and his team out there.", "is to retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus and his team out there.", "the"]}, {"question": "Who is the General?", "answers": ["Dave Petraeus"]}, {"question": "What did Fallon deny?", "answers": ["a magazine article's assertion that he had been forced to resign over his opposition to a possible war with Iran.", "opposition", "article's assertion", "he had been forced to resign over his opposition to a possible war with Iran.", "Iran.", "possible war", "resign", "forced"]}, {"question": "What is the best course for Iraq?", "answers": ["General Dave Petraeus", "high confidence", "to retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus and his team out there.", "retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus", "retain"]}, {"question": "What led to the resignation?", "answers": ["clashing with President Bush."]}, {"question": "What led to resignation?", "answers": ["after reportedly clashing with President Bush.", "Adm.

Defense Secretary Robert Gates, however, has signaled he would like to gauge the impact of the 6,000-troop increase before considering whether to send more.\n\n\n\nSupport in the United States for the war in Afghanistan has dipped to an all-time low.

Mahoney said he hoped that, with the 24-hour sandbagging effort at the Fargodome, that goal will be met by Thursday. iReport.com: Are you there? Share photos, video\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother factor threatening efforts is the possibility of freezing temperatures, because sandbags freeze together and then aren't individually stackable.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the stress, volunteers have been working around the clock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You got old people, young people -- all helping out,\" Mahoney said. \"It's heartwarming to see how many people are here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN's Robyn Sidersky contributed to this story.", "qa": [{"question": "What river is running 14 feet above flood stage?", "answers": ["Red"]}, {"question": "How many volunteers have come forward?", "answers": ["1,000", "10,000"]}, {"question": "How many volunteers?", "answers": ["1,000", "10,000"]}, {"question": "When was there a major flood?", "answers": ["1897.", "April 1897"]}, {"question": "What city prepares for flooding?", "answers": ["Fargo", "North Dakota"]}, {"question": "Where is the city of Fargo?", "answers": ["Dakota", "North"]}, {"question": "Wjat is the population of Fargo?", "answers": ["99,200"]}, {"question": "Which river was flooded?", "answers": ["Red"]}]}

He says applications such as Chordica and Beatmaker allow him to compose material and provide instant accompaniment for those spontaneous moments when he feels the need for a good sing (during the interview, Go broke into song every five minutes).\n\n\n\nGo's gadget of choice even doubled as a \"fifth member of the band\" during his July performance in front of 70,000 at London's Wembley Stadium.

He then enlisted his followers to suggest lyrics based on the pic, and wrote and recorded a song incorporating their comments: \"Love, I'm caught by the wind, I've lost all control, 'cause you caught my heart string ...\"\n\n\n\nSo the followers are entitled to royalties?

He died in hospital later that night.\n\n\n\nThe judge, Mr Justice Bean, told Bishop: \"You are at present a highly dangerous man,\" the Press Association reported.\n\n\n\n\"There is plainly a very significant risk to the public of serious harm caused by your committing further offences of violence.\n\n\n\n\"Because you had threatened his younger brother, Rob Knox was among those who tried to disarm you.

{"text": "NEW YORK (CNN)  -- One summer night in 2004, 3-year-old Riley Fox lay asleep on a couch not far from her 6-year-old brother on a chair in the living room. Their father was sleeping in a nearby bedroom.\n\n\n\nThe FBI joined the search for the killer of 3-year-old Riley Fox last month.\n\n\n\nJust before 8 a.m., Kevin Fox was awakened by his son. The boy told his father that Riley was missing from the sofa.\n\n\n\nFox searched for his daughter for 40 minutes inside and outside their Wilmington, Illinois, home and then called police, according to authorities. His wife, Melissa, was in Chicago participating in a charity walk, and when she found out, she rushed home.\n\n\n\nNearly 500 volunteers, along with police and family, searched for the little girl.\n\n\n\nHer body was found later that day in a river in Forked Creek, Illinois, just 4 miles from the family's home. She'd been bound and gagged with duct tape, raped and drowned, according to the Will County Sheriff's Office and the coroner's report.\n\n\n\nIt was June 6, 2004, the start of a horrific ordeal for the family.\n\n\n\nFox was arrested and charged with the killing, only to be exonerated by DNA evidence.\n\n\n\nMore than five years later, authorities have yet to capture Riley's killer.\n\n\n\nKathleen Zellner, Fox's attorney, said that the crime scene was brutal and that the theory is that Riley was snatched from her home, sexually assaulted and then thrown from the bridge overlooking the river where she drowned. Because her hands were bound and her mouth covered with duct tape, she was unable to swim or save herself, Zellner said.\n\n\n\nAccording to Zellner, Fox says that the night his daughter disappeared, he had gone to a street fair while the children's grandparents looked after them. On his way home, about midnight, Fox picked up his two sleepy children from their grandparents and put them to bed in the living room of the 500-square-foot cement box family home. Riley often fell asleep on the sofa and her 6-year-old brother on the chair near her while watching TV, Zellner said.\n\n\n\nFox has said the front door was wide open when he awoke, Zellner said, as was the back door. He has said he locked the front door before he'd gone to bed.\n\n\n\nThe back door's lock had been broken weeks ago; they typically propped a stack of laundry baskets against it to keep it shut. According to the family, those baskets had been removed and placed on top of the laundry machine by someone other than family members.\n\n\n\n\"From the beginning, we believed that someone was already inside the house waiting when Kevin got home with the kids that night, \" Melissa Fox said. \"But it was clear that police were looking at Kevin suspiciously.\"\n\n\n\nIndeed, five months later, Will County sheriff's officers arrested and charged Kevin Fox with the sexual assault and murder of his daughter. Zellner says the arrest came after authorities coerced a confession from him after 14 hours of relentless questioning.\n\n\n\nFox spent eight months in jail, but DNA evidence from the rape kit conducted on Riley's body finally exonerated him. There was no semen found during the autopsy, Zellner says, but saliva of an unidentified male was found on the duct tape covering Riley's mouth and elsewhere on her body.\n\n\n\nIn late 2007, the family won a $15.5 million wrongful-arrest suit against the sheriff's detectives.\n\n\n\nThe Foxes believe that the perpetrator was someone in the community who had been watching and targeting their daughter for some time.\n\n\n\n\"For weeks before her disappearance, I couldn't shake a feeling of uneasiness, strange noises at night outside our house, as if someone were lurking and watching us,\" Melissa Fox said.\n\n\n\nZellner believes that another big clue was a red car similar to a Chevrolet Cavalier parked outside the Fox home that night, before Kevin Fox and his children returned home.\n\n\n\n\"It's only been in the last few weeks that investigators have actively begun pursuing this case again,\" Zellner said, \"even though Kevin was cleared nearly four years ago.\"\n\n\n\nLast month, the FBI joined the investigation at the request of Will County State Attorney James Glasgow. FBI agents combed Riley's neighborhood and talked with neighbors and other potential witnesses.\n\n\n\n\"The FBI is bringing unprecedented resources and expertise to this investigation,\" Glasgow said in a statement. \"We cannot allow this horrific crime against an innocent child to remain unsolved.\"\n\n\n\nThe family is offering a $100,000 reward, and the FBI is offering $10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for Riley Fox's death.\n\n\n\nAnyone with more information is urged to call the FBI's Chicago office at 312-421-6700.", "qa": [{"question": "What sort of evidence exonerated Riley's father?", "answers": ["DNA"]}, {"question": "When was Fox slain?", "answers": ["One summer night in 2004,"]}, {"question": "When was her body found?", "answers": ["later that day", "June 6, 2004,"]}, {"question": "What was the age of Riley Fox when she died?", "answers": ["3-year-old"]}, {"question": "What is the name of the child who was slain?", "answers": ["Riley Fox"]}, {"question": "What was the reason the family blasts law enforcement?", "answers": ["coerced a confession", "Her body", "Riley", "found later that day in a river in Forked Creek, Illinois, just 4 miles from the", "home.

An American citizen who happened to be in the area suffered non-life-threatening injuries, the spokesman said.\n\nLebanese internal security forces said three Lebanese civilian bystanders were killed in the explosion in Beirut's Dora area, contradicting earlier reports of four.\n\nTwenty-one others -- including the American bystander -- were wounded in the explosion, which was caused by a 15-kilogram (33-pound) bomb placed in a car before the explosion, the security forces said.\n\nThe United States is outraged by the terrorist attack, said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is traveling with President Bush in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"I want on behalf of our country to say to those who were wounded, and certainly to the families of those who were killed, that our condolences are with them,\" she added.\n\nIt was not clear whether the blast was caused by a suicide attack or by a remotely detonated car bomb.\n\nA communique issued by the U.S. Embassy in Beirut said the embassy vehicle was apparently the intended target of the attack, and identified the driver and passenger as Lebanese security personnel for the embassy.\n\nBut McCormack cautioned against jumping to any conclusions on the intended target.\n\n\"We don't yet have a full picture of exactly what happened, who is responsible, who is exactly being targeted,\" he told reporters during the State Department's daily briefing.\n\n\"We will see over the next day or two ... where the facts lead us.\"\n\nCiting security concerns, McCormack would also not address unconfirmed reports that the vehicle was part of a convoy for departing U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Jeffrey Feltman.\n\nA U.S. Embassy statement said Feltman canceled a farewell ceremony that he was to host Tuesday night \"out of respect to the victims of today's terrorist explosion.\"\n\nIn addition to the American, an Iraqi and at least three Lebanese were among those wounded in the blast, according to a Western diplomatic source.\n\nVideo of the scene showed several damaged cars, including at least one that was left a pile of twisted metal. A nearby high-rise building also sustained damage.\n\nMohammed Chatah, senior adviser to Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, pointed out that the attack happened during \"a major political crisis\" in Lebanon, which has been without a president for nearly eight weeks amid a bitter political feud.\n\n\"This explosion just exacerbates a difficult situation,\" Chatah told CNN.\n\nTuesday's blast appears to be the latest in a series of attacks against pro-Western, anti-Syrian targets in the Lebanese capital.\n\nMost recently, an explosion in Beirut's Christian suburb of Baabda killed Brig.

You can sum it up in one sentence, which is a general thing about Moscow: people here live \"Sex and the City.\" They just want to go out and spend money and pretend they're rich and successful and live this dream.\n\n\n\nI recently had a conversation with the club editor of Timeout Moscow and I asked her if she thought the clubs were suffering right now with the economy. She said that in the modern \"New Russian\" culture people would rather sell their Mercedes than not go out and spend anywhere between $4,000 and $6,000 on a table in a club and admit that they're not rich anymore.\n\n\n\nMoscow is dominated by posh parties, but it's no different at a subculture place like a techno club -- you're always judged by the labels you wear, the car you drive and the music you identify yourself with.\n\n\n\nCNN: Where do you like to go in the city?\n\n\n\nCH: Novodevichy Monastery is a really beautiful old monastery. Stalin demolished a lot of churches and monasteries but this one was spared. There's a pond below it that you can walk around, and all the Russian Orthodox popes are buried in he cemetery. It's a very nice place.\n\n\n\nAnother place is would be Vorobyovy Gory (Sparrow Hills), where you can look out over Moscow. It's pretty industrial looking but it has good views.

People will spend three or four hours in traffic jams just to travel 60km -- and on the way back on Sunday and Monday mornings it's the same.\n\n\n\nSome \"dachas\" are really basic wooden houses and some are palaces but every family has one, or even two or three. People go out to the woods or lakes and they have barbeques, they drink and they do some gardening. They value this \"dacha\" life so much that they're willing to spend 6 hours in traffic to spend 1 \u00bd days in the woods.\n\n\n\nCNN: So is Moscow is deserted in the summertime?\n\n\n\nCH: Moscow is very quiet in the summertime -- it's my favorite time. You can already notice that there are less people in the clubs and less people in the streets at the weekend.\n\n\n\nTowards the end of June, Moscow is really empty. You really notice it from the middle of July until September, when it's school vacations.\n\n\n\nCNN: Has Moscow change a lot since you moved there?\n\n\n\nCH: Yes -- you can see it renewing itself. I know how it went with Berlin -- in 10 years you won't recognize Moscow anymore.\n\n\n\nStreets have changed so much in the last five years, in a good way and a bad way. A lot of cool-looking brick buildings were torn down to create business centers, but on the other hand you have great new modern buildings and hotels -- the Ritz Carlton for example. There are lots of new museums popping up, art centers, alternative art, new shops and cafes.\n\n\n\nIt's so different to when I came here five years ago and to be honest, I never would have expected it.\n\n\n\nCNN: What do you miss about Moscow when you're away?\n\n\n\nCH: I miss the excitement. There's something going on all the time. There's so much choice in terms of theater, classical ballet, the nightlife, the galleries.\n\n\n\nYou have that in Berlin but it's harder to find and not as exciting, and New York has lost a lot of its flavor, glamour and energy at the moment.\n\n\n\nCNN: If Moscow were a person, what would he or she be like?\n\n\n\nCH: An ugly princess who wears a lot of makeup and tries to be pretty!

{"text": "(EW.com) -- Enough with the chains and whips already. Ever since 2009's \"Rated R,\" the relentlessly dark, blood-on-your-hands record she released after being assaulted by her then boyfriend Chris Brown, Rihanna, 23, has equated falling for someone with feeling tortured.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn last year's \"LOUD,\" she even tried to make pain seem empowering with the hard-pounding single ''S&M.'' But between ''Love the Way You Lie,'' a domestic-violence saga played out with Eminem, and ''Man Down,'' a ragga-tinged murder ballad, she just sounded like she needed a hug.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it's a relief to find that on her blissed-out sixth album, \"Talk That Talk,\" she's stopped trying to play it so tough. ''I'll let you in on a dirty secret,'' she purrs on ''Roc Me Out,'' ''I just want to be loved.'' And apparently, love's never come so easily to RiRi, whose new song titles include ''We Found Love,'' ''We All Want Love,'' and (yes) ''Drunk on Love.'' Is she finally admitting that being young and crushed-out on someone might feel, y'know, kind of fun?\n\n\n\n\n\nAMA adult rating flat, but a hit with teens\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue, she's still got two token I-like-it-rough tracks -- ''Birthday Cake'' and ''Cockiness (Love It)'' -- but they're just filler on an album that's all about dragging you out of the bedroom and onto the dance floor. U.K. club king Calvin Harris trades Rihanna's usual somber synths for disco ecstasy on ''We Found Love,'' a song that builds and builds to a climax that's so arena-ready it practically begs for someone to blow a vuvuzela.\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaming with pop vet Dr. Luke, Harris offers up more house-DJ bait with ''Where Have You Been,'' which begins with a cold-pulsing 4/4 beat before falling into a rapturous Daft Punk-style breakdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly Clarkson, Bruno Mars on 'X Factor'\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's an international appeal to these songs, which were recorded in luxury suites across France, Germany, and Sweden.

{"text": "KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A Marine was killed in action and several others wounded Thursday in a major U.S.-led offensive in southern Afghanistan, the Marines said.\n\n\n\nU.S. Marines prepare for Operation Khanjar at Forward Operating Base Dwyer, Afghanistan, on Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe push, called Operation Khanjar, is targeting militants in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold and poppy-growing region. The forces are attempting to gain and hold ground in the perilous region ahead of national elections in August.\n\n\n\nAlmost 4,000 Marines and sailors, along with several hundred Afghan security forces and British troops, worked to clear Taliban militants from population centers in the Helmand River valley.\n\n\n\nThey have been operating in the districts of Nawa and Garmsir in central Helmand province and \"as far south as the vicinity of Khan Neshin, the capital of Rig district in the region of the Helmand River valley known as 'The Fishhook.' \"\n\n\n\nThe Marines stressed the mission \"is to provide security for population centers\" and \"connect local citizens with their legitimate government while establishing stable and secure conditions for national elections.\"\n\n\n\nHelmand's governor, Gulab Mangal, said he believes the operation will work and has assured the populace that it will provide security for them. His spokesman also confirmed that resistance had been minimal.\n\n\n\nThe Marines said about 80 percent of the American troops are in direct combat, with the rest working in support.\n\n\n\nTaliban resistance has been light and sporadic, consisting of intermittent small arms fire, the Marines said on Thursday. The troops have encountered only relatively small groups of militants.\n\n\n\n\"Indications are the militants break away shortly after they make contact,\" Marine spokesman 1st Lt. Abe Sipe said, referring to what is regarded as the Taliban's habit of running and hiding after troops confront them.\n\n\n\nA Taliban spokesman said the group's fighters had killed 33 soldiers and destroyed several vehicles. CNN could not independently verify the Taliban claims because of safety and access issues.\n\n\n\nThere has been an outcry in Afghanistan over civilian deaths in the Afghan war's crossfire, with much ire directed toward coalition air operations.\n\n\n\nBut the Marine Expeditionary Brigade-Afghanistan emphasized in a news release that the Marines have not \"received any confirmed reports of civilian casualties or damage to property.\" They said they have not utilized \"artillery or other indirect fire weapons, and no bombs have been dropped from aircraft.\"\n\n\n\nThe brigade operates under NATO's International Security Assistance Force.\n\n\n\nThe assault has prompted Pakistani authorities to redeploy troops along the Afghan border to stop Taliban from escaping the push in Helmand. More than 30 U.S., British and Danish troops have been killed there since January, with the latest being the Marine on Thursday and a pair of British soldiers slain in Helmand on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe push is the largest since the Pentagon began moving additional troops into the conflict this year, and it comes after a British-led operation launched last week in the same region, the Marines said.\n\n\n\nWhen President Obama announced his strategy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan, he said American soldiers and Marines \"will take the fight to the Taliban in the south and the east, and give us a greater capacity to partner with Afghan security forces and to go after insurgents along the border.\"\n\n\n\nHe also said the bolstered deployment \"will also help provide security\" ahead of August presidential elections in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration has moved about 21,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan, the original front in the war launched after the September 11 attacks.\n\n\n\nIt is also the first big move since U.S. Gen. Stanley McChrystal took over as the allied commander in Afghanistan in mid-June. In Washington, a senior defense official said the size and scope of the new operation are \"very significant.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's not common for forces to operate at the brigade level,\" the official said. \"In fact, they often only conduct missions at the platoon level. And they're going into the most troubled area of Afghanistan.\"\n\n\n\nThe defense official said the operation is a \"tangible indication\" of the new approach that McChrystal -- a former chief of the Pentagon's special operations command -- is bringing to the nearly eight-year war.\n\n\n\n\"They're not just doing an offensive push to get bad guys; they're going in to hold the area and stay there,\" the official said. \"This approach is indicative of McChrystal's philosophy: measuring success by the number of Afghans protected, not bad guys killed.\"\n\n\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing in June, McChrystal told senators that the conflict requires a new focus on counterinsurgency to reduce violence and build support for the U.S.-led NATO alliance among Afghans.\n\n\n\n\"Although I expect stiff fighting ahead, the measure of success will not be enemy killed. It will be shielding the Afghan population from violence,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe Islamic fundamentalist Taliban ruled most of Afghanistan before its allies in al Qaeda attacked New York and Washington on September 11, 2001. Though quickly toppled after the attacks, its leaders escaped, and the movement regrouped in the Afghan countryside and across the border in Pakistan.\n\n\n\nHelmand was once known as the breadbasket of Afghanistan, but the fertile land is now used for growing poppies. Afghanistan produces more than 90 percent of the world's opium, with most of that coming from the poppies in Helmand.\n\n\n\nThe drug trade is an import source of income for the Taliban and major supply routes run through the province.\n\n\n\nCNN's Atia Abawi in Afghanistan, Nic Robertson in Pakistan and Chris Lawrence and Barbara Starr at the Pentagon contributed to this report.", "qa": [{"question": "how many talibam died", "answers": ["33 soldiers"]}, {"question": "According to the Taliban, how many soldiers where killed?", "answers": ["A Marine", "33", "4,000 Marines and sailors,"]}, {"question": "where is the operation focused", "answers": ["Helmand province,"]}, {"question": "Where did Operation Khanjar take place?", "answers": ["Forward Operating Base Dwyer, Afghanistan,", "Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold and poppy-growing region.", "targeting militants in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold and poppy-growing region."]}, {"question": "how many troops were involved", "answers": ["several hundred", "along with several hundred", "Almost 4,000 Marines and sailors, along with several hundred Afghan security forces and British", "Almost 4,000"]}, {"question": "How many soldiers took part in the Operation Khanjar?", "answers": ["4,000 Marines and sailors, along with several hundred Afghan security forces and British troops,", "4,000", "4,000 Marines and sailors,"]}]}
{"text": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Ready for your Super Bowl party? Sure, you have drinks, hot wings, maybe even a favorite jersey. But do you have an M-16, a Kevlar helmet and body armor?\n\n\n\nPittsburgh Steelers fan Sheresa Coleman will watch the Super Bowl from the USS Mahan in the Gulf of Aden.\n\n\n\nNot everybody is watching the game from the comfort of the family den.\n\n\n\nHundreds of thousands of U.S. troops will be deployed in remote war zones, on lonely oceans and at overseas bases -- all far away from an NBC affiliate. So the military is going out of its way to make sure that many soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors can watch Super Bowl XLIII live.\n\n\n\n\"Super Bowl day has really become a holiday, military-wise, over the last couple years,\" said Petty Officer 1st Class Grant Shannon.\n\n\n\nShannon is from a town about an hour north of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but is on board the USS Mahan, a destroyer deployed to stop pirates working off the coast of Somalia.\n\n\n\nWhen they finish their duties, sailors like Shannon can head to the ship's mess to watch the Pittsburgh Steelers take on the Arizona Cardinals. The same is true for soldiers, Marines and airmen in combat zones.\n\n\n\n\"We can broadcast to every forward operating base in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" said Andreas Friedrich, the deputy director of Armed Forces Radio and Television Services, which has been sending the Super Bowl to troops overseas since the first Super Bowl, broadcasting it live since 1981.  Watch how troops will be able to watch big game \u00bb\n\n\n\nAll told, about 1 million American military personnel and civilians overseas will be able to watch the big game.\n\n\n\nSome of those watching will be benefiting from the same technology that makes Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle missions possible.\n\n\n\nA global broadcast system will beam the game to ships and submarines far out in the Pacific Ocean. GBS is how pilots in the United States can watch and fly an unmanned vehicle over a battlefield halfway around the world, and then feed what they see to the battlefield commanders on the ground below.\n\n\n\nRaytheon, the company that runs the system, will use one of its video channels to feed the game to several U.S. Navy submarines and ships in the Pacific. Tens of thousands of sailors will be able to see the game via GBS, which first broadcast a Super Bowl in 2003, according to Guy DuBois of Raytheon.\n\n\n\n\"It's a pretty amazing feeling, when you get to do that, to watch it on the ship and knowing that everybody else is back home having a good time, just like we will be,\" said Petty Officer 3rd Class Ryan Wright, a Cardinals fan from Arizona. Wright is on board the USS San Antonio, an amphibious transport dock that is part of the anti-piracy task force.\n\n\n\nA Steelers fan on board the USS Mahan agrees.\n\n\n\n\"It would be nice to be home and watch the game in my hometown,\" said Seaman Sheresa Coleman of Pittsburgh. \"But it's a great honor to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\n\n\nOne thing Wright and the other overseas Super Bowl viewers will miss is the legendary Super Bowl commercials. Friedrich said the Armed Forces Radio and Television Services would have had to pay high fees for the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl commercials to an international audience.\n\n\n\nInstead, the multimillion-dollar ads that some people consider the best part of the game will be pre-empted in favor of Department of Defense-produced ads and public service messages.\n\n\n\nStill, even without seeing football-playing Clydesdales or movie-shilling monsters, those in uniform appreciate being part of America's unofficial midwinter holiday.\n\n\n\n\"We have lots of sailors and Marines on board who have followed the season,\" said Cmdr. Eric Cash, the commander of the USS San Antonio. \"Any time we can enjoy some traditional American sports like the Super Bowl, it's always a great time for us, a good mental break and also a good time for people to get together and socialize.\"\n\n\n\nJust like home.

She and the others -- Manson, Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles \"Tex\" Watson -- were initially sentenced to death in the slayings of five people, including Tate, and two additional deaths the following night.\n\n\n\nTheir sentences were automatically commuted to life in prison when the Supreme Court struck down the nation's death penalty laws in 1972.\n\n\n\nBy her own admission, Atkins held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy, and stabbed the actress, who was eight months pregnant, 16 times. In a 1993 parole board hearing, Atkins said Tate \"asked me to let her baby live. ... I told her I didn't have any mercy on her.\"\n\n\n\nAfter killing Tate, according to historical accounts of the murders, Atkins scrawled the word \"pig\" in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski. Polanski was not home at the time, but three of Tate's houseguests were also slain by the killers, as was a teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his nearby cottage.\n\n\n\nIf the panel decides to grant Atkins parole -- called a \"tentative suitability finding\" -- the decision is subject to a 120-day review process by the California Board of Parole Hearings, Thornton said. If it still stands, the matter then goes to the governor's office. The governor's options include allowing the decision to stand, actively approving it, modifying it or reversing it, according to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's Web site.\n\n\n\nHowever, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has previously opposed Atkins' request for compassionate release -- a request made by terminally ill patients wishing to be released before death. The Board of Parole Hearings unanimously denied that request in July 2008. It was also opposed by Debra Tate, Sharon Tate's sister.\n\n\n\nIf parole is not granted, another hearing will be set in three, five, seven, 10 or 15 years, at the discretion of the panel, Thornton said.\n\n\n\nAtkins has been described as a model prisoner who has accepted responsibility for her role in the slayings and now shuns Manson.\n\n\n\nBut Debra Tate told CNN in an e-mail in March she does not believe any Manson family member convicted of murder should ever be set free, saying the slayings were \"so vicious, so inhumane, so depraved, that there is no turning back.\"\n\n\n\n\"The 'Manson Family' murderers are sociopaths, and from that, they can never be rehabilitated,\" Debra Tate said. \"They should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die. There will never be true justice for my sister Sharon and the other victims of the 'Manson Family.' Keeping the murderers in prison is the least we, as a society who values justice, can do.\"\n\n\n\nIn a manuscript posted on her Web site, Atkins, who was known within the Manson family as Sadie Mae Glutz, wrote that \"this is the past I have to live with, and I have to live with it every day.\"\n\n\n\n\"Unlike the reader, or the people who seem to think Charles Manson was cool, I can't think about it for an hour or so and then go on with my life. Just like the families and friends of the victims, this is with me every day. I have to wake up every day with this and no matter what I do for the rest of my life and no matter how much I give back to the community I will never be able to replace what my crime took away. And that's not 'neat,' and that's not 'cool.'\"\n\n\n\nAtkins' brain cancer was diagnosed in March 2008, Whitehouse wrote on his Web site. On May 15, doctors predicted she would live less than six months. But she passed that deadline, he wrote, and celebrated her 21st wedding anniversary on December 7.", "qa": [{"question": "Has she been given parole?", "answers": ["hearing", "a", "Susan Atkins,"]}, {"question": "Who has admitted stabbing actress Sharon Tate to Death.", "answers": ["Susan Atkins,"]}, {"question": "In which year was Susan Atkins denied compassionate release from prison.", "answers": ["July 2008.", "2008."]}, {"question": "How many times has Susan Atkins been denied parole.", "answers": ["13th", "12", "hearing"]}, {"question": "Did susan Atkins stab Sharon Tate to death?", "answers": ["stabbed actress"]}, {"question": "How many times has she previously been denied parole?", "answers": ["13th", "Susan Atkins,"]}, {"question": "Who did she stab to death?", "answers": ["former \"Manson family\" member", "Sharon Tate"]}, {"question": "How long is Atkins expected to live?", "answers": ["less than six months."]}]}

{"text": "(CNN) -- Doctors chose a woman who survived a shotgun wound to her face as the first recipient of a face transplant after treating her for nearly four years.\n\n\n\nThis image projects what Connie Culp, 46, may look like two years after the face transplant.\n\n\n\nConnie Culp knew of the Cleveland Clinic's interest in face transplants and approached the medical staff, doctors said at a news conference Tuesday.\n\n\n\nDr. Maria Siemionow, the Cleveland, Ohio, hospital's director of plastic surgery research and head of microsurgery training, had more than 20 years of experience in complex transplants. By 2004, Siemionow was looking for the right candidate for a face transplant who wasn't doing it for vanity.\n\n\n\n\"They are not looking to go out on the street and be beautiful,\" Siemionow told CNN in a 2006 interview. \"Some of these patients, when they were interviewed just said 'I want to walk on the street and just make sure I am not sticking out.' They just want to have a normal face.\"\n\n\n\nThe doctors examined the patient's history, motivation and ability to understand the risks of the transplant. And they found Culp to be an ideal candidate.\n\n\n\nFive years after a gun blast shattered her nose, cheeks and upper lip, she had a band of scar tissue extending across her face.\n\n\n\n\"The most devastating of all was the fact that society had rejected her and children were afraid of her,\" said Siemionow, who led the December 10 transplant operation.  See before and after photos of Culp \u00bb\n\n\n\nCulp, a mother of two and a grandmother, told her doctors she could understand that some adults would shun her.\n\n\n\n\"But what really bothered her the most were children -- the children that shied away from her,\" said Dr. Frank Papay, the chairman of Institute of Dermatology and Plastic Surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. \"That sense of innocence, and her not being able to see that innocence really, really affected her.\"\n\n\n\nThe shooting\n\n\n\nIn September 2004, Culp's estranged husband shot her in the face in an attempted murder-suicide outside a restaurant in Hopedale, Ohio, according to CNN affiliate WTOV in Steubenville, Ohio.\n\n\n\nCulp was 8 feet away from her husband, Thomas Culp, when he pulled the shotgun's trigger. He then turned the weapon on himself, according to local news reports. They both survived. Thomas Culp was sent to prison.\n\n\n\nDespite her wounds, she told WTOV in 2008, \"I'll always love him. He was my first love.\"\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Culp said, she felt angry. \"I wouldn't be human if I didn't. I forgive him, but I have to go on, you know?\"\n\n\n\nAfter the shooting, Culp recuperated in a hospital and in a personal care home for two years. Culp told WTOV she had vision problems and was learning Braille.\n\n\n\nHer approach to life was to \"keep motivated. Don't sleep your life away -- that could have happened. I could be depressed. I'm not.\" As she spoke, her breaths emitted a small whistle from her tracheotomy tube, which protruded from a surgical opening in her neck.\n\n\n\n\"I cannot smell. I will never be able to smell,\" she said in the interview.\n\n\n\nCulp was wrong.\n\n\n\nHow doctors transplanted a face\n\n\n\nThe doctors at the Cleveland Clinic analyzed Culp's injuries using CAT scans and developed plastic models of her skull. They practiced face transplant operation on cadavers several times.\n\n\n\nCulp met with the hospital's surgeons, ethical committee members and psychiatry and psychology specialists who determined that she was an ideal candidate for the surgery. Then, the wait for the right donor began in 2008.\n\n\n\n\"We thought we were going to wait a long time because we had to find a Caucasian female in her mid 40s to match Connie, so we expected a year before we were able to find a donor,\" said Papay, who is also head of craniofacial surgery. \"Well, three to four months later, I got a call at around midnight from Dr. Siemionow saying 'I think we have a donor.'\"\n\n\n\nThe family of a brain dead woman granted permission to use her face.\n\n\n\nHe likened the preparation for the December transplant to a rocket launch, saying, \"Everything was prepared beforehand very, very, very carefully.\"\n\n\n\nSurgeons sheared out the donor's mid-facial area including the lower eyelids, cheekbones, the nose, some of the sinus and the whole upper jaw, with the blood vessels.  Watch CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta discuss the face transplant \u00bb\n\n\n\nWhen it came time to move the donor's parts to Culp, they had to see that the donor and recipient parts aligned.\n\n\n\n\"One of the ways you can tell that is how your upper teeth fit to the lower teeth,\" Papay said. \"We knew it was like a hand in a glove, exactly where we needed to be.\"\n\n\n\nThey secured the bones into Culp's face using titanium plates and screws. Then the microvascular surgeons attached the vessels. They tucked the scars around Culp's ears or underneath her eyelid, where they would not be visible.  How the doctors operated \u00bb\n\n\n\nDoctors added more skin than needed in case of tissue rejection. After monitoring Culp's progress, doctors say they will remove the excess tissue and tighten her jawline in future surgeries.\n\n\n\nContrary to science fiction and movies, the surgery did not make Culp look like the donor.\n\n\n\n\"If you just took the skin and transplanted it to the other patient, the bony structure is different,\" Papay said. \"If you took the bony structure and transplanted it on the other side, it ends up being a composite. So, it doesn't look like the donor. It doesn't look like the recipient. It ends up looking like someone new.\"\n\n\n\nRecovery\n\n\n\nAt this point, all the transplanted parts of Culp's face are functioning except for her facial nerves, which are growing about an inch a month. Doctors anticipate Culp will be able to have full facial function -- and more expression --  by this winter.\n\n\n\nIn physical therapy, she learns to train her nerves, make facial expressions, smile and purse her lips, doctors said.\n\n\n\n\"If you cry or you laugh or you smile, it's not like you think about it. You just emotionally do it. So that's a wait and see for us,\" Papay said. \"As far as the emotional one, that's really the key issue. A far as when she laughs, cries and grimaces and gets angry at you...what's her face going to look like? That's the exciting part about it.\"\n\n\n\nFive months after the first face transplant in the United States, Culp lives at home. She has checkups with the medical staff once or twice a month and will do so for the next year, her doctors said.\n\n\n\nInitially, Culp used immunosuppressants that transplanted kidney, liver or heart patients would normally take. Transplant patients must take immune-suppressing drugs throughout their lifetime to prevent tissue rejection. But she showed improvements that enabled the doctors to reduce her regimen to one medication, doctors said.\n\n\n\n\"She's taking her medications,\" Siemionow said. \"We know she is compliant. She cares about how she looks. She has her hair done in a new color...She is full of life. She does her push-ups. She's on the treadmill.

Past artificial hearts have only had one pump.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe French model is made from natural materials including polymer and pig tissue, which have already been used in heart valves implanted into people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe artificial heart would initially be for patients who had suffered a massive heart attack or who had heart failure, but might eventually be used in patients who are not that sick.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeart disease is the world's top killer, claiming some 17 million lives a year. According to the American Heart Association, about 2,200 heart transplants were performed in the U.S. in 2006.

{"text": "Editor's note: Journalist Karl Penhaul spent several weeks tracking the gangs of the Mexican underworld, the corrupt officials who support them and the cops trying to halt the violence. This is the last of three exclusive reports. The first focused on the violent rules gangs live by and the second looked at  how gangsters are honored in death.\n\nForensic investigators and federal police dig bodies out of mass graves in the desert near Juarez.\n\nJUAREZ, Mexico (CNN) -- Heat waves shimmer over the desert. A team of forensic experts clad in white overalls excavate three shallow graves.\n\nThe sand gives up nine bodies -- seven men and two women. At least one of the victims' hands were cuffed behind their back. Others had been trussed up with duct tape.\n\nThe stale stench reveals that the corpses had been dumped there several days earlier and were decomposing fast.\n\nThat grisly find in mid-March came a week after thousands more soldiers had been deployed to Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. The arrival of the soldiers and more federal police agents had coincided with a short lull in the killings.\n\nSnapping photos of the scene from behind the police line was Lucio Soria, photographer for Juarez's main newspaper, El Diario de Juarez, and its sister paper, PM.\n\nPM is a perfect example of Mexico's so-called \"red press,\" newspapers that specialize in covering violence. Soria seems like a perfect ambassador.\n\n\"I've gone for a week and a half without taking pictures of dead people. I was thinking 'Hell, what am I going to do?' At this rate I'll end up taking pictures for the social pages,\" he said.\n\nSoria realizes snapping pictures of blood and gore may seem heartless. But he stays cheerful, cracking dark jokes with colleagues, all while listening to police communications on a radio scanner and searching for clues about where to find the next drug war victim.\n\n\"It might seem ugly, but that's our job,\" Soria said.\n\nHe and fellow photographers have been busy in recent months.\n\nLast year, Juarez became the poster city for Mexico's narco-violence, with more than 1,600 gang killings.  Watch musicians play \"narco-ballads\" honoring hitmen \u00bb\n\nThis year, Mayor Jose Reyes is trying to turn a page on the killings and make Juarez a showcase for solutions.\n\nMilitary and federal police convoys patrol the streets around the clock. Cops armed with AR-15 assault rifles, identities obscured by ski masks, hang off pickup trucks that speed around in twos and threes.  Watch cops round up gang suspects \u00bb\n\nSoldiers strike a warlike pose behind heavy machine guns mounted on American-made Humvees.\n\nWhether it's working depends on whom you ask and how hard you read between the lines.\n\n\"I think this is very effective because it closes transport routes for the movement of [cartel] personnel and weapons,\" said a state officer, assigned to guide us, at a federal police checkpoint.\n\nThe officer, known only by his call sign Trojan One, seemed confident.\n\nThe agent in command of the checkpoint was less convinced.\n\n\"Of course organized crime is trying to avoid us. I'm not sure what methods they use to operate. We don't know how they work,\" said the officer, identifying himself only as Aztec One.\n\nOn another day we ran into a three-truck federal police operation staking out a house in a middle-class Juarez neighborhood.  See photos of police, gang life in Mexico \u00bb\n\nThe commander said his men believed they had made what he termed a \"major\" cocaine bust. When I met him they had already been waiting almost 24 hours for a judge to issue a search warrant.\n\nWhen they gained access they discovered some 500 half-gram bags of cocaine. In Juarez those bags sell for around $8. Now do the math, 500 half-gram bags at possibly 60 percent purity means around 150 grams of pure cocaine -- hardly a major strike in the drug war.\n\nReyes' solution has been to hand the military all civilian police functions, even down to traffic control. Mexico's military has little experience in urban warfare, little experience in policing and has been unable to shake a decades-old reputation for human rights abuses.\n\nWhen I bump into Reyes at a transfer-of-command ceremony at city hall I ask him what he's doing about alleged corruption and complicity among politicians and businessmen, who permit the cartels to move their shipments and help launder the proceeds.\n\n\"My opinion in Juarez is that that kind of political corruption does not exist,\" he said adamantly.\n\nTwo weeks later, in Monterrey, I caught up with outspoken lawyer Raquenel Villanueva. She knows a thing or two about politicians colluding with Mexico's mafia.  Watch how drug lords pay tribute to a highway bandit, looking for luck \u00bb\n\nMexican media have dubbed her the \"devil's advocate\" for her role in defending a string of senior cartel figures and their hitmen. Last year, she was detained for 90 days, accused her of being a member of the Gulf Cartel. She was freed without charge.\n\nThroughout her career, she's survived four assassination attempts and taken 10 bullets, two of them in the head.\n\nHer office is crammed with religious iconography: crosses, paintings of the Virgin of Guadalupe and a four-foot-high wooden statue of Saint Jude Thaddeus. Two bullets are encrusted in the effigy after the last attempt on her life in 2000.\n\n\"I know about official corruption and exactly who is doing what because my clients tell me,\" she said.\n\n\"To win the drug war you have to tell the Americans to take better care of their young people, tell them to stop being so cold and materialistic,\" Villanueva lectured. \"Then you have to end corruption and that means changing the government cabinets of half the countries in the world.\"", "qa": [{"question": "What is says Lawyer?", "answers": ["because my clients tell me,\" she said."]}, {"question": "Who puts blame on materialistic Americans?", "answers": ["Villanueva"]}, {"question": "who do lawyers blame?", "answers": ["the government cabinets of half the countries in the world.", "official corruption"]}, {"question": "How many gang killings happened last year in Juarez?", "answers": ["more than 1,600", "became the poster city for Mexico's narco-violence, with more than 1,600"]}, {"question": "how many gang killings occurred last year?", "answers": ["more than 1,600"]}]}

{"text": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Former detainees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the country during their deportation.\n\nRaymond Soeoth, pictured here with his wife, says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will.\n\nOne of the drugs in question is the potent anti-psychotic drug Haldol, which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses. Doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered.\n\nTwo immigrants, Raymond Soeoth of Indonesia and Amadou Diouf of Senegal in West Africa, told CNN they were injected with the drugs against their will.\n\nBoth are plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the government. They are seeking an end to the alleged practice and unspecified damages.  Watch why the former detainees claim abuse \u00bb\n\nDr. Paul Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry, law and ethics at Columbia University, reviewed both men's medical records for this report and was stunned by what he discovered.\n\n\"I'm really shocked to find out that the government has been using physicians and using potent medications in this way,\" said Appelbaum, who also serves as a member of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.\n\n\"That is the sort of thing that would be subject to a malpractice claim in the civilian world.\"\n\nThe allegations of ICE forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, during the re-nomination hearing of ICE chief Julie Myers.\n\n\"The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling, particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards,\" Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips told CNN in an e-mail.\n\n\"Senator Lieberman intends to follow up with ICE to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so.\"\n\nACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham, who is representing Soeoth and Diouf, said, \"It would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who isn't even mentally ill. ... But here, it's happening on U.S. soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport.\"\n\nResponding to Lieberman's written questions, Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had \"medical escorts\" for deportation since 2003.\n\nFrom October last year to the end of April this year, she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process. Of those, 33 detainees received medication \"because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self,\" she said.\n\n\"First, I am aware of, and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards,\" Myers said.\n\nShe added no detainee should be \"involuntarily medicated without court order,\" except in emergency situations.\n\nBut both Soeoth and Diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior.\n\nSoeoth, a Christian minister from Indonesia, spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected. Hours before he was to be sent back home on December 7, 2004, he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days. See the document that shows Soeoth was injected\n\n\"They pushed me on the bench, they opened my pants, and they just give me injection,\" he said through broken English.\n\nHe says he was taken to Los Angeles International Airport while in this drug-induced stupor, but two hours before takeoff, airline security refused to transport him, so ICE agents returned him to his cell at Terminal Island near Los Angeles. Terminal Island, once a federal prison, is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation.\n\nSoeoth's medical records indicate he was injected with Cogentin and Haldol, even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness.\n\nIn the records, the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark Soeoth denies ever making.\n\nICE said in a written statement it couldn't respond to specific allegations due to pending litigation.\n\n\"Department of Homeland Security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees,\" the ICE statement said. \"Only trained and qualified medical professionals, including officers of the U.S. Public Health Service, may prescribe or administer medication.\"\n\nBut, Diouf says, he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported. He said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his U.S. government escorts wouldn't let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country. See Diouf's stay of deportation document\n\nThat's when, he says, \"I was wrestled to the ground and injected through my clothes.\"\n\nA government report says he was medicated because he did not follow orders.\n\nIn both cases, Diouf and Soeoth remain in the United States pending a decision in the case.

{"text": "(CNN) -- Union workers armed with an estimated 1.5 million signatures converged on Washington on Wednesday, demanding that Congress pass their highest-priority legislation.\n\n\n\nUnion chief Andy Stern wants workers to have another way to organize besides relying on a secret ballot.\n\n\n\nThey are lobbying for the Employee Free Choice Act. The legislation would allow a company's employees to openly sign a card demanding a union and then, if a majority sign, the company involved would have 90 days to negotiate. The act would also stiffen federal laws that bar employers from intimidating or firing workers who try to bring in a union.\n\n\n\nBut while the battle is just beginning on Capitol Hill, business owners like Dave Bego have been in the center of the fight for some time.\n\n\n\nBego, of Indianapolis, Indiana, is the owner of EMS, a company that provides janitors to businesses around the country. The family-owned company has been under fire by one of the nation's most powerful labor organizations, the Service Employees International Union.\n\n\n\nThe 1.8 million-member SEIU argues that EMS intimidates, harasses and violates the rights of workers wanting to unionize. It has made the company a target of repeated protests for about three years. But Bego said the claims are unfounded, and it's the union that has harassed him.  Watch how company, union are at odds \u00bb\n\n\n\nHe said the union has sent his clients threatening letters for using his company, staged noisy protests, confronted employees, blocked building entrances and released balloons in a client's building to disrupt business. He said his workers don't want a union, because they make more in pay and benefits without having to pay SEIU's labor dues.\n\n\n\n\"We have several hundred people working for us in Indianapolis [alone],\" Bego said. \"They've been after us for almost three years, and they've got only about 10 or 12 people interested in what they said. If our people really needed protecting, don't you think they'd be out in mass droves in the street with the union protesting EMS? Do you think we'd still be in business? I don't think so.\"\n\n\n\nBut union workers CNN talked to said EMS employees are afraid to speak publicly because they might get fired, as Shaneka Brown said she was. She said EMS fired her after she complained about what she said were unsafe conditions.\n\n\n\n\"We're not the only ones,\" Brown said. \"There are millions of other janitors and millions and millions of other companies that are going through same similarities or different similarities, but they're going through things that are not right and not safe.\" That's why she supports the Employee Free Choice Act, she said.\n\n\n\n\"When polls show that 60 percent of the workers in America want to organize, yet only 7 percent belong to unions, you know something's broken,\" one of the bill's sponsors, Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, told Wednesday's union rally in Washington.\n\n\n\nThe option to vote by secret ballot would still be available. But critics say the measure -- dubbed the \"card check\" bill by its opponents -- would effectively eliminate union elections, removing a fundamental hard-earned right of workers and forcing some workers into unions they don't want to join.\n\n\n\n\"Card check is real simple,\" Bego said. \"They want to eliminate the secret ballot election. And that is kind of like saying, 'We're going to elect the president of our country by signing cards.

{"text": "Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Just like any other first family in the world, North Korea's secretive Kim dynasty is often the focus of gossip and rumors, especially in neighboring South Korea.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a lot of speculation after a recent report that Kim Jong Il's grandson, identified as 16-year-old Kim Han-sol, was scheduled to enter an international school in Bosnia. Less than a week after the report, YouTube screen shots and pictures -- reportedly of the grandson -- have been plastered on the news in South Korea.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported that it had tracked down photos of the grandson from the Bosnian school's Facebook page and published the pictures. The young man appears in photos wearing a suit and black horn-rimmed glasses posing with a woman at what appears to be a party.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another photo, the young man sports a blonde hairdo and is wearing a black T-shirt on the streets. The news agency reported Kim's nationality on the school website was set as North Korean. The school, the United World College in Mostar, confirmed its acceptance of a 16-year-old North Korean student named Kim Han-sol through a press release but stopped short of confirming the identity of the individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The entry of a student from North Korea, furthermore from a very well-known family, has understandably generated surprise and comment, some of it critical,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Yonhap News Agency, Kim Han-sol is the son of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's oldest son, Kim Jong-nam. Kim Jong-nam is the family's most outspoken member and has been seen at airports and other venues outside of North Korea. He is viewed by many as the outcast of the Kim family. It is believed the oldest Kim fell out of favor when he was stopped in Japan trying to enter on a forged passport on his way to Disneyland in 2001.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe South Korean media has also focused on YouTube postings that Yonhap News Agency says feature Kim Han-sol. Yonhap released shots in which the YouTube user claims to be a North Korean studying in Macau. The person also claims to be \"related (to the Kim family).\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN could not independently confirm the identity of the YouTube user or the person shown in the pictures in the South Korean media. There are no known public photographs of Kim Han-sol and there's been no comment from the Kim family.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reclusive nature of the family leaves media outlets to leap at whatever opportunity they can to gain more insight into the lives of the Kim Jong Il family. Experts have commonly used photos released by the North Korean state-run news agency to speculate on the health of Kim Jong Il, examining facial color, posture, and even the style of shoes the leader is wearing.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the lack of access to verify most of what is circulated in the news has also led to blunders in the past. A photograph once released as an exclusive shot of one of the leader's sons later turned out to be an average South Korean man. The incident was only corrected after the man in the photo spoke out saying he was shocked to see he had turned into a Kim dynasty member overnight.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the latest round of speculation continues, the YouTube account reportedly linked to the grandson is no longer accessible and has been closed.", "qa": [{"question": "who  will reportedly attend a Bosnian international school?", "answers": ["Kim Han-sol,"]}, {"question": "when The 16-year-old Kim Han-sol will reportedly attend a Bosnian international school?", "answers": ["Less than a week"]}, {"question": "whose  family is rarely shown in photographs?", "answers": ["dynasty", "North Korea's secretive Kim", "Kim", "Kim Han-sol"]}, {"question": "who  has published alleged photos of Kim Jong Il's grandson?", "answers": ["South Korea's Yonhap News Agency", "YouTube"]}, {"question": "Where did the pictures come from?", "answers": ["Bosnian school's Facebook page", "YouTube"]}]}
{"text": "ATLANTA, Georgia -- Going back to work after my wife had our first child was an emotional roller coaster.\n\n\n\nThe author says that being \"Mr. Mom\" is appealing, but putting the idea into practice is harder than it looks.\n\n\n\nI forced myself out of bed, shaved my beard and got dressed on the morning of my return. I performed these work week rituals while cursing the fact that I matched only one number on my last lottery ticket, so I had to show up that day.\n\n\n\nAfter being out of the office for a little more than two weeks on paternity leave, I knew the transition back to work would be tough. I coped with this fact, like any rational new parent would, by increasing the number of lottery tickets that I purchased.\n\n\n\nSaying goodbye took a while. I made several trips up and down the stairs to get one more glimpse of my daughter before succumbing to the inevitable: my commute, fighting traffic and reintegrating to cubicle culture.\n\n\n\nI arrived at the office still thinking of my family at home without me. I found myself misty-eyed at the water cooler while I waited for Outlook to load several hundred unread e-mails. At that moment, I wanted nothing more than to be at home with my daughter.\n\n\n\nThe idea of being a stay-at-home dad, like Michael Keaton in \"Mr. Mom,\" always appealed to me. For the uninitiated, the 1983 comedy is about an out-of-work father faced with domestic challenges while his wife gets a job.\n\n\n\nA memorable scene has the title character, Jack Butler, trying to sound like he knows what he's talking about to his wife's new boss. He tells him that he plans to wire a new wing of his house in \"220, 221, whatever it takes.\"\n\n\n\nI identify with the latter part of his character's claim. It's not like me to pretend to know anything about home improvement, but when it comes to caring for my family while balancing my responsibilities at work, I plan on doing whatever it takes.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, 37 percent of working dads admitted that they would leave their jobs if their family could afford it, according to CareerBuilder.com. The \"if\" in that statistic is a big one.\n\n\n\nUnlike the characters in \"Mr. Mom,\" my wife and I both need to work. A good sequel to this film may have explored the hijinks that ensued from an overwhelmed parent caring for a newborn while working from home.\n\n\n\nNowadays, there's support for all of the Jack Butlers out there. Web sites such as AtHomeDad.org and Rebeldad.com have established online communities dedicated to providing tips and resources for fatherhood.\n\n\n\nThese forums represent a growing fellowship where those with experience can help new dads. Personally, I haven't utilized them much yet because of that old Groucho Marx joke about not wanting to be a member of a club that would have a person like me as a member.\n\n\n\nAvailable resources and social acceptance for stay-at-home dads have come a long way since \"Mr. Mom's\" portrayal of them. In fact, Salary.com calculated that a stay-at-home dad was worth $125,340 a year for the dad portion of his work in 2006. This analysis took into account tasks that range from cooking and cleaning to teaching and serving as a child psychologist.\n\n\n\nSince I can't convince anyone to pay me my estimated worth as an at-home dad -- and living on one salary isn't an option for my family -- I've considered working from home a couple of hours a week when necessary.\n\n\n\nFlexible work schedules make sense because they benefit a company by allowing employees to be more productive on their terms. Nevertheless, working from home may not be for everyone.\n\n\n\nI work for a news Web site, facilitating advertisement opportunities. A lot of my job's communication occurs via e-mail, which is something I can do at home.\n\n\n\nI'd worked from home before, but not with a newborn in the house. My first test was only for a couple of hours when the baby was about 3 weeks old.\n\n\n\nMy wife had an early appointment, and I was going to watch the baby sleep, hopefully, and then go into the office after she got home. I had e-mail to check and two conference calls scheduled back-to-back during that time. I didn't expect this to be too difficult.\n\n\n\nI caught up on the e-mail much earlier than if I had gone into the office that morning. Unfettered from the restriction of the morning rituals, my productivity was already soaring and I was ahead of schedule.\n\n\n\nThen disaster struck.\n\n\n\nAs I called into my first meeting, the baby started to stir, squirm and make her signature sounds (a primal series of grunts, snorts and whimpers). She was telling me that her diaper needed to be changed and that she was probably hungry, too.\n\n\n\nSo I did what any multi-tasker would do: I put the phone under my ear, stuck her bottle under the tap, muted the phone, ran up the stairs with her in a tucked football position, unmuted the phone, answered a question, muted again, changed her diaper and ran down the stairs to get the bottle.\n\n\n\nMy wife called while I was juggling the baby, diaper, bottle and meeting to let me know that she was running late. I screamed to myself, \"I need help NOW!\"\n\n\n\nAllowing the nervous breakdown to run its course, I continued to pace across my living room floor -- regretting that I hadn't chosen decaf that morning.\n\n\n\nA few minutes later, I jumped out of the first meeting to call into the second. I said, \"Hello, this is Josh, I'm here on mute, OK, thanks.\"\n\n\n\nAs I listened in on mute, I shushed my baby to calm her -- to no avail. Her cries became increasingly louder. My boss asked, \"Josh, are you there?\"\n\n\n\nI unmuted my phone and right on cue, my daughter screamed at the top of her little lungs.\n\n\n\nThe conference room on the other end of the phone erupted with laughter, and I told them that I'd have to get back to them.\n\n\n\nMy wife arrived home shortly after the conference-call debacle. I told her that I didn't think it would be a good idea for me to work from home anymore.\n\n\n\nI realize that the ability to work and be a nanny simultaneously is a skill requiring practice.\n\n\n\nOne trial run as a telecommuter with a newborn has caused me to question the feasibility of being able to do it on a regular basis.\n\n\n\nPerhaps it's time for me to forget about that old Groucho Marx joke and accept some help.

Jackson, South Carolina\n\n\n\nTranscript\n\n\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\nNATISHA LANCE, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: A member of the military is making history. We'll explain how in today's edition of CNN Student News. Hi, everyone. Carl Azuz is off this week. I'm Natisha Lance.\n\n\n\nFirst Up: Afghan Crashes\n\n\n\nLANCE: First up, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The countries share a border, and they also share a common problem: threats from militant groups and terrorists like the Taliban and al Qaeda. It's an issue facing both nations' governments, and one that the U.S. government is concerned about as well. That's why President Obama has been holding a series of meetings with some of his advisers. They're reviewing the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Samantha Hayes has the latest on those meetings and on the violence in the region.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO)\n\n\n\nSAMANTHA HAYES, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: Two helicopter crashes make it the deadliest day in four years for Americans in Afghanistan. While a NATO security force spokesman says enemy fire is not to blame, the loss of 14 Americans comes while President Barack Obama is considering a request to send thousands more troops to the region to fight al Qaeda. The president addressed service men and women in Jacksonville, Florida Monday, after a White House meeting with his national security team.\n\n\n\nU.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Fourteen Americans gave their lives, and our prayers are with these service members, their civilian colleagues and the families who loved them.\n\n\n\nHAYES: The deadliest of the two crashes happened following a raid on suspected drug traffickers, and three DEA agents were among those killed. Also among the dead, three U.S. civilians, members of the embassy community. The State Department says the efforts of civilians and other nonmilitary personnel are essential to the overall mission.\n\n\n\nJACOB LEW, DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE: Improving Afghan governance, providing security, justice, jobs and services, and giving the Afghan people a meaningful alternative, as much as possible, to the Taliban's recruiting.\n\n\n\nHAYES: Democratic Senator John Kerry, off of a recent trip to the region, addressed those efforts and the U.S. relationship with the Afghan government in a Washington speech.\n\n\n\nSEN. JOHN KERRY, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: The fact that the Afghan government has not prosecuted a single high level drug trafficker damages all of our efforts because it goes to the fundamental question of credibility.\n\n\n\nHAYES: President Obama's White House meeting was the sixth in a series of high-level discussions about what to do in Afghanistan, as the administration awaits results from that country's November 7th presidential runoff. For CNN Student News, I'm Samantha Hayes.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO)\n\n\n\nI.D. Me\n\n\n\nCNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I was born in 1939 in Searchlight, Nevada. I was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986, and I'm currently the Senate Majority Leader, which means I'm the highest ranking member of the Senate's majority party. I'm Harry Reid, a Democrat who is the senior senator from Nevada.\n\n\n\nPublic Option\n\n\n\nLANCE: And in that role as majority leader, it's Sen. Reid's job to help combine health care bills from different committees into a single bill that can be presented to the entire Senate. Yesterday, Sen. Reid announced that the combined bill will include a government-run health care program; what's been called the public option. During his announcement, Reid also said that the bill will let individual states choose not to take part in the public option. They would have until the year 2014 to make that decision.\n\n\n\nThis has been one of the most controversial issues in the debate over health care reform. Critics argue that if companies use the public option, then some people might lose the health care coverage that they currently have and are happy with. But Sen. Reid believes it's an important part of the reform.\n\n\n\nSEN. HARRY REID, (D-NV) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I believe that the public option can achieve a goal of bringing meaningful reform to our broken system. It will protect consumers, keep insurers honest, ensure competition, and that's why we intend to include it in the bill that we submitted, that will be submitted to the Senate.\n\n\n\nTea Party Protests\n\n\n\nLANCE: Meanwhile, the Tea Party Express is back on the road, protesting issues like government involvement in health care. The Express, which is named for both the organization and its bus, launched a new tour Sunday in California with rallies in San Diego and Los Angeles, where some people actually showed up to protest the Tea Party protesters. The Express plans to hold demonstrations in dozens of cities over the next several weeks. One of the group's main goals is the push for less government involvement, and these rallies also aim to give people who feel that way an opportunity to express their views.\n\n\n\nCHRIS KEAYS, TEA PARTY PROTESTER: We need to get back to the days when we were responsible and we assumed the responsibility of ourselves and our families, and the government is not a part of my daily life. I really resent the government taking up so much of my time that I'm down here having to protest right now.\n\n\n\nNew Jobs Outlook\n\n\n\nLANCE: And some potentially good news for the U.S. economy: A new survey indicates that companies are planning to hire more employees in the very near future. The report from the National Association of Business Economics says for the first time since the recession started nearly two years ago, the number of employers planning to hire workers over the next six months is higher than the number of jobs that are expected to be cut during that same time. The country's current unemployment rate is 9.8 percent. That's the highest the statistic has been in more than a quarter century.\n\n\n\nShoutout\n\n\n\nTOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What base is home to the U.S. Army's Drill Sergeant School? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Fort Bragg, B) Fort Hood, C) Fort Jackson or D) Fort Knox? You've got three seconds -- GO! You'll find the Army's Drill Sergeant School at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout!\n\n\n\nTop Drill Sergeant\n\n\n\nLANCE: Drill sergeants are responsible for training tens of thousands of soldiers every year. And the head of the Drill Sergeant School, its commandant, is responsible for training them. The current commandant broke new ground when she took over the position last month because she's the first she to head up the school. Jason Carroll introduces us to this trailblazing soldier.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO)\n\n\n\nJASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Historically, this is the image of the military drill sergeant: a tough guy. That was then; this is now. At 48, Command Sergeant Major Teresa King is the first woman to lead the Army's Drill Sergeant Training School.\n\n\n\nWhat are you looking for? I mean, because it all pretty much looks like everybody's exercising to me.\n\n\n\nCMD. SGT. MAJOR TERESA KING: I'm looking for attention to detail, conformance.\n\n\n\nCARROLL: Before sunrise at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina, King readies her drill instructor candidates for a rigorous run.\n\n\n\nWhat's wrong with that?\n\n\n\nKING: That's too big, Top. You need to break it up.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fall out!\n\n\n\nCARROLL: She leads by example. King runs the five-mile course from the front of the pack, outperforming men half her age.\n\n\n\nSTAFF SGT. LERON DELANEY, U.S. ARMY: She's older than me, so if I fall out and she's still running, I feel bad.\n\n\n\nCARROLL: Extinguishing those who think a woman can't be commandant.\n\n\n\nSGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL CHILDS, U.S. ARMY: We've got to stay on top of our game even more than we used to with her, because she's that sharp.\n\n\n\nCARROLL: King says she wakes up some mornings still shocked she is commandant.\n\n\n\nKING: I had never considered it, although I've been in training for about seven years. But I never considered it, the Drill Sergeant School.\n\n\n\nCARROLL: King's first Army job some 30 years ago was postal clerk, but her hero, General George Patton, inspired her.\n\n\n\nKING: I saw that he had the respect of his men. And I saw he was resolute.\n\n\n\nCARROLL: King eventually rose through the ranks, excelling at training infantry men and paratroopers alike.\n\n\n\nKING: I'm doing what I've always done. It's just now, people are paying attention to it.\n\n\n\nCARROLL: And to her opinions. The military prohibits women from serving in front line combat roles. King trains men for combat and thinks it's time to train qualified women.\n\n\n\nKING: I think if they can do it, they should be allowed to do it.\n\n\n\nCARROLL: The reality: Women make up 14 percent of active soldiers in the Army. Some women question how many others will follow in King's footsteps.\n\n\n\nOPERATIONS SGT. ANGELA ANDREWS, U.S. ARMY: I wouldn't say it opens the door, but it may crack it somewhat.\n\n\n\nCARROLL: King says she will continue to lead by example.\n\n\n\nKING: I have vision. And I believe I can cause people to do some things that they thought they never could do.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO)\n\n\n\nBefore We Go\n\n\n\nAZUZ: Before we go, some science projects can balloon out of control. Which was the whole point of this experiment in Indiana. College students filled this high altitude balloon with helium and then let it fly away. The thing actually climbed 90,000 feet before... awww. Looks like their bubble burst. Actually, they knew it would. The cameras and sensors inside the balloon gently parachuted back to the ground. So in the end, the experiment was a total success.\n\n\n\nGoodbye\n\n\n\nAZUZ: Just don't tell that to the students. We wouldn't want them to get an inflated ego. That's all the time we have for today.

{"text": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's memorial service will take place Tuesday morning in the Staples Center, the 20,000-seat coliseum in downtown Los Angeles where Jackson rehearsed his show the night before he died, according to a person who has been briefed by a representative of the family.\n\n\n\nMichael Jackson was rehearsing at Los Angeles' Staples Center. His memorial will now be there.\n\n\n\nNo other details about the service, set to begin at 10 a.m. Tuesday, have been revealed.\n\n\n\nThursday, CNN learned the family trust created by Jackson to receive all of his assets includes his mother, his children and a list of charities, according to a person with direct knowledge to the contents of the trust.\n\n\n\nKatherine Jackson's 40 percent share would go to Michael Jackson's three children after her death, the source said.\n\n\n\nThe children -- ages 7, 11 and 12 -- will also share 40 percent of the estate's assets and the remaining 20 percent will benefits charities designated by the executors of the will, the source said.\n\n\n\nJackson's will did not specify where he wished to be buried.\n\n\n\nMany of his fans had hoped they'd get a chance to pay last respects at Neverland Ranch, which Jackson purchased in 1987, filled with animals and amusement rides, and named after the fictional world in J.M. Barrie's \"Peter Pan.\"\n\n\n\nPlanning had been under way for a motorcade to carry Jackson's body from Los Angeles to the ranch in Santa Barbara County, California, which state and local officials suggested would be difficult and costly.\n\n\n\nA public viewing at the ranch on Friday also had been under consideration, law enforcement sources said.\n\n\n\nGregory Son, a 31-year-old musician, was among many fans who had planned to ride to the ranch to say goodbye to Jackson.\n\n\n\n\"I think he was a modern-day prophet,\" Son said outside Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. \"We kind of lost our father.\"\n\n\n\nDEA joins investigation\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday night, a federal law enforcement official said Wednesday night that the Drug Enforcement Administration had joined Jackson's death investigation, once again fanning speculation that drugs may have been involved in the pop icon's passing.\n\n\n\nTwo law enforcement officials separately confirmed the DEA probe, saying agents would look at various doctors involved with Jackson, their practices and their possible sources of medicine supply.\n\n\n\nNeither official wanted to be identified because they could not comment publicly on the matter.\n\n\n\nOfficially, a DEA spokeswoman referred questions to the Los Angeles, California, police department -- which would not confirm the involvement.\n\n\n\n\"We routinely offer assistance to any agency regarding the Federal Controlled Substance Act,\" said Sarah Pullen of the DEA. \"However, at this time, we have nothing further to comment about the death of Michael Jackson.\"\n\n\n\nSpeculation about the role of drugs has been swirling since Jackson died on June 25 at his rented estate in Holmby Hills. The cause of his death, at age 50, was pending toxicology results.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, police released a car belonging to Jackson's cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray.

{"text": "QUANTICO, Virginia (CNN) -- Motorcycle accidents have killed more Marines in the past 12 months than enemy fire in Iraq, a rate that's so alarming, it has prompted top brass to call a meeting to address the issue, officials say.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite crashes, Gunnery Sgt. Art Tucker rides a sport motorcycle. \"I enjoy it. ... It relaxes me,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwenty-five Marines have died in motorcycle crashes since November -- all but one of them involving sport bikes that can reach speeds of well over 100 mph, according to Marine officials. In that same period, 20 Marines have been killed in action in Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 25 deaths are the highest motorcycle death toll ever for the Marine Corps.\n\n\n\n\n\nGen. James Amos, the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, told CNN that commanders are trying to drill down on what \"we need to do to help our Marines survive on these sport bikes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Marines are very serious about it,\" he said.  Watch these aren't your father's Harleys \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nMarine Gunnery Sgt. Art Tucker knows all too well about the dangers of sport bikes. An owner of a Kawasaki Ninja, Tucker has had two crashes, and the second one nearly killed him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I sustained a broken collar bone; I tore the shoulder out of the socket; I tore three ligaments in the shoulder, the rotator cuff; I broke three vertebrae,\" said Tucker, a drill instructor for new officers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The worst was a head injury I received: a bruised brain. And it caused hemorrhaging, and from that I had partial paralysis of the left leg, full paralysis of the left foot and toes, and that was for approximately six months.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAmos said he and other top Marine officials will spend half the day Monday \"focusing on nothing but motorcycle issues.\" The commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James Conway, and other senior leadership will attend the meeting at the Quantico, Virginia, Marine base, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 18,000 of the nearly 200,000 Marines are believed to own motorcycles, Amos said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Marines have taken some measures. The Marine Corps has had a long-standing policy for all Marines who ride motorcycles to take a mandatory basic riding course. More recently, it added a second training course specifically designed to train Marines who ride sport bikes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny Marine caught riding, even on leave, without going through the training courses faces Marine Corps punishment, officials say.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a recent day at the Quantico training track, Marines whizzed by on their bikes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the basic rider course has been great,\" said Cpl. Austin Oakley. \"Here, they put you in situations you want to be wary of out in that open road.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOakley said he recently returned to the United States from Japan, and he immediately jumped at the chance to buy a sport bike. He said it's not uncommon for Marines to have motorcycle clubs within their units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We'll go out on rides together. Fridays for lunchtime, we'll all meet up and go to lunch,\" Oakley said. \"When I get on my motorcycle, it's me and the motorcycle. I don't need to go fast. I don't need to do anything like that. It's just being free.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rise in motorcycle deaths isn't confined to Marines. The Navy says it's had 33 deaths on motorcycles over the past 12 months, a 65 percent jump from the previous time period. And authorities say motorcycle deaths have been a problem in the civilian world, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nMilitary officials say they're not sure why the deaths are on the rise. They initially believed that the accidents might involve mostly young Marines and sailors about 18 or 19 years old. But Navy statistics show that five of the victims were 25, the most prevalent of any age involved in the crashes. And two 40-year-old sailors were killed in motorcycle crashes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmos said the Marines have seen a similar trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he says the new training seems to be working: Of the 300 young men and women who have gone through the sport-bike course, only three have had accidents.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe safety course instructors said some Marines who go through the training decide the sport bike is not for them.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut even some Marines who've survived past crashes still want to ride again, even after they get the new training.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I enjoy it,\" said Tucker. \"I can actually get on my motorcycle and ride, and it's just like if I were to do bowling or rock climbing or scuba diving.

{"text": "(CNN) -- In Mexico City, the government ran out of surgical masks after handing them out to one of every five residents.\n\n\n\n\n\nA mother and son wear face masks as protection from swine flu at Sydney international Airport in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nManufacturers and pharmacies in Europe are also reporting a surge in demand for face masks. And a Texas-based surgical mask producer says it's ramping up to meet demand and expects a shortage of masks.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut their real value seems to be in keeping people who are already ill from spreading the virus, rather than protecting healthy people, experts said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Richard Besser, acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Monday in a press briefing that the \"evidence is not very strong\" for masks' value outside of health care settings, and outside of settings in which people come into face-to-face contact with a person with an infectious disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We would not recommend that people generally wear masks in their workplace as a precautionary measure,\" he said.  Watch for more on staying safe from swine flu \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) also warns against relying on face masks, especially for those not infected with the virus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are mainly useful for people who are already sick, to prevent spreading. Not so much to stop people from catching the virus,\" Sarah Cumberland of the WHO told CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Kingdom's Health Protection Agency also told CNN that the use of face masks was not necessary or recommended for protection against the swine flu virus.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it's not known for sure how much benefit a surgical mask has in preventing the transmission of swine flu, people who have the illness may consider wearing one as a way to reduce the amount they cough and sneeze onto others, said Dr. Arthur Reingold, head of the epidemiology division at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that this is a perfectly reasonable thing for someone with a respiratory illness to do,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore effective than soft surgical masks is the N95, which is an example of a \"respirator.\" This kind of tight-fitting face covering protects people against breathing very small particles, which may contain viruses. The downside is that it's more expensive, uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time and has to be custom fit, Reingold said, so it's suited for people working in high-risk laboratories.\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks carry both physical and psychological benefits, said Dr. Julio Frenk, former health minister of Mexico and current dean of the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks are a \"reminder to people that they should avoid close contact with other persons,\" he said. \"They also have this effect of isolating people and reminding them that they should not be kissing people, shaking hands, things like that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor health care workers, it's important to have high-efficiency masks, which protect better against infectious diseases, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut people in the United States should generally not have to wear masks because the cases are localized, he said. By contrast, it is more of a widespread problem in Mexico, especially in the capital city, a \"huge urban conglomeration.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasures such as closing schools are the most effective in stopping the spread of the disease, he said. Mexico's schools are closed until at least May 6.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy early Tuesday, the swine flu outbreak in Mexico was suspected in 152 deaths and more than 1,600 illnesses, the country's health minister said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSwine flu has reached  phase 4 (out of 6) on the pandemic scale, according to the WHO guidelines, but has not yet attained the status of global pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a flu pandemic, people should consider wearing a face mask if they are sick with the flu, live with someone who has the flu or need to be in a crowded place, the CDC Web site says.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are caring for a person thought to have pandemic flu or will be close to someone who may have it, consider a respirator, for example an N95 or high-filtering face piece respirator, the CDC Web site says. Some health care workers, such as nurses and doctors, use respirators when dealing with patients who have airborne diseases, the CDC said. iReport.com: Worried about swine flu?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the current swine flu situation, rather than masks, the CDC is pushing hand-washing, covering coughs and refraining from \"giving somebody that little kiss of greeting,\" Besser said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you're in an infected area or if you have the swine flu, it's probably best not to, to not give a kiss, but we're not recommending an end of affection during the period.

{"text": "Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant is just weeks from operating at full capacity, the country's top nuclear official said Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeireidoun Abbasi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, also said Tehran has shown its new Iranian-made centrifuges to a representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bushehr plant, located along the Persian Gulf coast, will reach its full capacity of 1,000 megawatts by February 1, Abbasi said, according to the country's official news agency, IRNA.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plant was connected to the country's electric grid in September with a capacity of 60 megawatts. At 1,000 megawatts, Bushehr will be able to provide 2.5% of Iran's current electricity consumption, the IAEA said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbasi made the announcement about Bushehr while attending a meeting on Iran's nuclear achievements held in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told the meeting that Tehran had shown the new generation of its homemade centrifuge machines to the IAEA \"in a bid to demonstrate the ability of Iranian scientists,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbasi said the centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium, were shown to the deputy of IAEA, Director-General Yukiya Amano, but he did not say when.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether an IAEA representative had in fact been to Iran and seen the centrifuges.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new centrifuges will enable Iran to enrich uranium over the current purity level of 5%, according to experts cited by the news agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nUranium enriched to between 3% and 5% is necessary to make fuel for reactors. Uranium enriched to 93.5% is considered weapons-grade.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe construction of Bushehr -- a civilian, not military, plant -- started in 1975 when Germany signed a contract with Iran. Germany, however, pulled out of the project following the 1979 revolution that created the current Islamic republic.\n\n\n\n\n\nIran then signed a deal with Russia in 1995, under which the plant was originally scheduled to be completed in 1999, but the project was delayed repeatedly. Bushehr finally opened in August 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States and other Western nations have expressed concerns that Iran's development of missile and nuclear fuel technology mean it is developing a nuclear program for military purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IAEA said in a November report that it has \"serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions\" to Iran's nuclear program. The agency said it has information indicating Iran has carried out \"activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIran has denied such allegations, saying the Bushehr plant will be used only to generate electricity and operates under IAEA supervision.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the concern is not the Bushehr plant, but other nuclear facilities like Natanz, in the middle of the country; a facility at Qom, south of Tehran; \"and other places where we believe they are conducting their weapons program.\"", "qa": [{"question": "When will the plant reach full capacity?", "answers": ["February 1,", "just weeks from operating at"]}, {"question": "Who believes that iran will be able to enrich uranium beyond 5% purity?", "answers": ["experts cited by the news agency.", "Abbasi"]}, {"question": "Did the IAEA representative confirm that they had seen the centrifuges?", "answers": ["said Tehran has shown its new Iranian-made", "machines to the", "Tehran", "of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).", "shown the new generation of its homemade", "to a"]}, {"question": "Who were shown the centrifuges?", "answers": ["to a representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).", "Yukiya Amano,", "to a representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency"]}, {"question": "What is Bushehr's plants full capacity?", "answers": ["Iran's", "1,000 megawatts", "of 1,000 megawatts"]}, {"question": "What is the full capacity of the plant?", "answers": ["1,000 megawatts"]}, {"question": "What is considered to be weapons grade?", "answers": ["Uranium enriched to 93.5%"]}]}
