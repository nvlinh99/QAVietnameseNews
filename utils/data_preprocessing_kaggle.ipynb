Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the Democratic and Republican vice presidential candidates, had their first and only live debate on October 1 before the November election. American viewers watched the confrontation between the two deputy generals on fifteen news channels. The Nielsen Media Data Analysis Company released statistics on October 2 that the debate attracted about 43 million viewers, including more than 9 million people between the ages of 35 and 54 and more than 3 million between the ages of 18 and 34. The largest audience over 55 was 29 million. This was lower than the 57.9 million viewers watching the 2020 confrontation between vice presidential candidates Mike Pence and Kamala Harris. Vance and Walz focused primarily on policy, talking about immigration, abortion rights, the U.S.economy, and the conflict in the Middle East. Despite their opposition, the two candidates had many moments of mutual agreement on some issues. The poll conducted by CBS/YouGov after the debate showed a similar percentage of support for the two candidates, with 42 percent saying Vance won and 41 percent choosing Walz. 17 percent of respondents rated the two candidates as a draw. Vance, 40, was chosen by former president Trump as a deputy candidate at the Republican National Convention in July. Harris selected Walz, 60, as a running mate in August, after she was nominated by Democrats to replace Joe Biden for the job.

Bà sinh ở Slovenia, chuyển đến Mỹ làm người mẫu từ năm 1996 và gặp ông Trump hai năm sau. Năm 2005, hai người kết hôn và có một con trai là Barron Trump, năm nay 18 tuổi.\nSau khi ông Trump rời Nhà Trắng, bà ưu tiên sự riêng tư của gia đình, tập trung nuôi dạy con và thường vắng mặt trong các sự kiện tranh cử của chồng. Bà dành nhiều sự quan tâm cho sáng kiến Be Best, dự án do bà thành lập năm 2018 với mục tiêu phát triển phúc lợi xã hội và sức khỏe thể chất, tinh thần trẻ em.\nHồng Hạnh (Theo AFP)\n \n\n\nTrump's wife advocates for women's abortion. Contrary to her husband's position, which supports the ban on abortion, Melania Trump argues that women need to have a right to make decisions about their bodies. \"It is necessary to ensure that women have autonomy, to make decisions about their own births, from their own point of view, without government interference or pressure,\" the Guardian quoted in an upcoming memoir by Melania Trump, wife of former president Donald Trump. Her views differ from those of Trump, who is a Republican presidential candidate. During his campaign, Trump often proudly introduced his decision to nominate three judges to the Supreme Court that paved the way for the 2022 judge ruling to reverse the recognition of women's abortion rights. At least 20 states in the United States have since enacted regulations that completely or partially prohibit abortion, including Georgia, which prohibits abortions older than six weeks. Abortion was a hot topic before the U.S. presidential election this year. Public opinion polls show that U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, is gaining more voters than Trump on this issue. \"Why does no one but women have the right to decide what they can do with their bodies? A woman's basic personal freedom, for her life, gives her the right to terminate a pregnancy if she chooses,\" Melania writes. \"Restricting a woman to choose to terminate a pregnancy against her will is like denying her the right to control her body. Throughout my adult life, I have always held this view,\" the memoir says. Melania Trump, 54, is Trump's third wife. She was born in Slovenia, moved to the United States to model in 1996, and met Trump two years later. In 2005, they married and had a son, Barron Trump, who is 18. After Trump left the White House, she prioritized family privacy, focused on parenting, and was often absent from her husband's campaign events. She was much interested in the Be Best initiative, which she founded in 2018 with the goal of developing social welfare and physical and mental health for children.

The missiles have successfully reached their targets and the enemy remains secretive about the results of the strike,\" Yahya Saree, the Yemeni Houthi Force spokeswoman, said today. The announcement was made almost a day after the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched nearly two hundred ballistic missiles against a series of military bases around Tel Aviv and other Israeli areas, in retaliation for the deaths of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, and IRGC Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan. The Houthi spokesman congratulated Iran on the Israeli raid, stating he was willing to participate in \"all coordinated operations\" with Tehran. The Yemeni armed group also warned that U.S. and British interests in the region would be at risk if the two countries continued to support Israel. The Quds are long-range cruise missiles that Houthi had commissioned in July 2019 in various versions. The force claims to have developed its own Quds, while some Western experts say they are scaled-down versions of the Iranian or Russian Kh-55 Soumar series. There is no information on the Quds-5, while older Quds-3s are believed to reach Eilat in the southernmost part of Israel when launched from Yemen. After the outbreak of hostilities in the Gaza Strip in October 2023, Houthi forces have repeatedly used unmanned aerial vehicles and rockets to raid Israeli territory to show support for Hamas, an ally in the \"resistance axis.\" Houthi last week fired a missile at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, prompting Israeli air strikes against the group\\'s targets in Yemen. In addition, the Yemeni armed group frequently raids Israeli-connected cargo ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, causing shipping companies to bypass the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa, increasing shipping costs. U.S. and British forces in the region have repeatedly attacked Houthi targets in Yemen, in response to and to prevent the enemy from continuing to raid international shipping, but the operation appears to have been ineffective, albeit for almost a year.

The Israeli military said that some air bases were hit by Iranian ballistic missiles, but no serious damage was recorded. The Israeli army today said that the series of ballistic missiles fired by Iran on October 1 hit the office buildings and maintenance areas of several air force (IAF) bases. However, they assessed all Iranian missiles that hit Israeli air bases as \"ineffective,\" without damaging IAF operations. The force suffered no losses in fighter, drone, other aircraft, ammunition depots, and critical infrastructure. The Israeli army noted that the IAF had continued its operations after Iran fired nearly two hundred ballistic missiles at Israel. IAF fighters attacked Hezbollah groups in Beirut, supported ground forces in southern Lebanon, and targeted targets in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli Medical Agency confirmed that one civilian was killed, two were lightly wounded by missile fragments after a major Tehran air strike. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said it evaluated the effectiveness of an attack based on the damage to infrastructure, critical assets, and casualties, rather than on the number of missiles hitting the territory. The IDF confirmed that its anti-aircraft system had succeeded in preventing Iranian missiles from causing major damage and casualties. The force was also preparing for a counterattack at the behest of its leader. This was the first time Israel admitted that Iranian missiles hit its military bases. Earlier, the IDF had claimed to have \"majorly intercepted\" Iranian missiles, but the released videos showed a series of bullets that penetrated the Israeli anti-aircraft grid and crashed to the ground and exploded. Comparative geographic data showed that the hit areas in the videos included Tel Nof and Nevatim airports. Iranian Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh said that 90 percent of its missiles penetrated the Israeli anti-aircraft grid and that Tehran targeted only enemy military installations. The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said it had used the Fattah super-echo missile for the first time in the Israeli raid. However, the Israeli military said no missiles launched into the country were the super-echo model Tehran reported. At a security cabinet meeting in a bunker near Jerusalem after the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Iran had \"made a big mistake\" and \"would pay the price.\" This was the second time Iran had raided Israel in the last six months. In April, Iran fired 300 missiles and drones toward Israeli territory. The IDF also announced that it had successfully intercepted most of its weapons from Iran., link: https://vnexpress.net/israel-thua-nhan-ten-lua-iran-danh-trung-can-cu-quan-su-4799561.html',\n '\"I condemn the escalating conflict in the Middle East, with its escalating moves. This must stop. We desperately need a ceasefire,\" United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres posted on social media October 1 after Iran launched a series of ballistic missiles to bombard Israel. Iran\\'s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on the night of October 1 announced the launch of Operation True Promise 2, targeting Israeli military bases, including the Nevatim, Tel Nof and Hatzerim airports. Iranian officials claimed the country launched nearly 200 missiles, while the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) estimated Iran to launch around 180 ballistic missiles. President Joe Biden stressed the U.S. security commitment to Israel, saying Washington was discussing the appropriate response with Tel Aviv and planned to phone Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \"The U.S. will support Israel comprehensively,\" Biden commented, noting that Washington was still waiting for Tel Aviv to decide on the direction of its response to Tehran. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also said Iran\\'s missile attack was \"serious developments\" and a \"significant escalation.\" Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the Middle East developments indicated that Biden\\'s administration\\'s regional policy had failed. \"The bloody tragedy was just going on. Vague statements from the White House indicated complete inability to resolve the crisis. The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken\\'s efforts only led to gridlock and tens of thousands of people becoming victims,\" Zakharova said. China\\'s Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing deep concern about the Middle East instability, highlighting Beijing\\'s opposition to the infringements on Lebanon\\'s sovereignty, territorial integrity and security, as well as moves to increase tensions and confrontation. \"China calls on the international community, especially influential powers, to play a constructive role and avoid further destabilization,\" the statement read. \"China believes the Gaza war is a source of Middle East upheaval and all parties should act quickly to reach a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire agreement.\" European Council chairman Charles Michel said the missile attack from Iran on Israel was an act of regional security threat. \"The parties should immediately end the deadly spiral in the Middle East. Regional - scale warfare will not benefit any country,\" Michel stressed. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called on Iran to \"end the spiral of violence\" against Israel, while Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares repeated the message \"all parties, including Israel, should refrain from escalating.\" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on October 1 announced support for Israel\\'s self - defense and national security, but declined to comment on whether British troops would support Israel\\'s response to Iran. A spokesman for the British Prime Minister\\'s Office said Starmer had spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about Middle East tensions. British Defence Minister John Healey revealed \"British forces have joined forces to prevent escalation in the Middle East,\" but did not reveal in detail. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on October 2 also said Iran\\'s missile attack on Israel was \"unacceptable,\" criticizing Iran\\'s escalation toward \"comprehensive war\" in the Middle East., link: https://vnexpress.net/cac-nuoc-keu-goi-iran-israel-ngung-leo-thang-xung-dot-4799343.html',\n 'Tokyo, however, emphasized its willingness to work with Washington to \"defuse the region and prevent tensions from escalating into full - scale war.\" French President Emmanuel Macron took a similar stance on the attack, condemning Tehran and pledging support for Tel Aviv, and declaring French military resources in the Middle East to \"resolve the threat from Iran.\" Macron also called on Israel to end its operation in Lebanon \"as soon as possible\" to protect civilians, calling on Hezbollah to end all attacks on Israel. Paris emphasized that \"all crisis stakeholders in the Middle East should exercise maximum restraint.\" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged Iran and the armed group Hezbollah to immediately cease all attacks on Israel, stressing that Berlin and its partners would continue to push the parties to reach a ceasefire agreement. \"Iran is threatening to burn the entire region. We need to stop it at all costs,\" the German government leader declared. In his post on X following the missile attack, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian asserted that Tehran was \"not looking for war,\" but would be resolutely defending itself against any threat, adding that the missile attack on Israel was \"just the tip of the iceberg.\" \"This is a drastic response to Israeli aggressive acts based on Iran\\'s right to legitimate regional peace and security,\" Pezeshkian wrote. \"This action is to protect Iranian interests and people.\" Iranian officials asserted that the missile strike on Israel was a move \"in accordance with Iran\\'s international right to self - defense.\" The IRGC warned Israel would suffer \"destructive and destructive\" consequences if it continued its vicious cycle of military retaliation. Pro-Tehranist organizations such as the Houthi forces in Yemen, Hamas in Gaza, and the resistance coalition in Iraq declared support for the Iranian strike. The Iraqi militia coalition warned the U.S. against military intervention in the region and opposed Israel\\'s use of Iraqi airspace in response to Iran, threatening to target U.S. bases and interests in Iraq and across the Middle East if Iran were attacked., link: https://vnexpress.net/cac-nuoc-keu-goi-iran-israel-ngung-leo-thang-xung-dot-4799343.html',\n 'Israeli intercept of Iranian ballistic missile series Nearly 200 ballistic missiles were launched by Iran into Israeli territory on the evening of October 1. Tel Aviv said the majority were intercepted in the sky by anti-aircraft systems, while Tehran claimed 90 percent of the shots hit the target. Iran said the missiles targeted three Israeli military bases near Tel Aviv City, including Nevatim Airport, Tel Nof, and Hatzerim., link: https://vnexpress.net/khoanh-khac-israel-danh-chan-loat-ten-lua-dan-dao-iran-4799221.html',\n 'Iran\\'s overloading tactic with the Israeli air defense net Iran has launched a massive wave of ballistic missiles at a small number of targets in Israel, in an effort to overwhelm the enemy\\'s multilayered air defense network. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on October 1 announced its \"Positive Promise 2\" campaign against three Israeli military bases near Tel Aviv, including Nevatim, Tel Nof, and Hatzerim, claiming that 90 percent of the missiles \"hit the target.\" The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said Iran had launched more than 180 ballistic missiles against the country, while the Pentagon estimated that Tehran fired nearly two hundred rounds. Tel Aviv claimed that the majority of the missiles were intercepted, and that the Israeli air force \"is still fully operational and will continue to strike hard in the Middle East.\" However, in videos released by the Israeli Foreign Ministry, only a handful of Iranian missiles were fired in the air, with several rounds successively going down and producing large ground explosions. Comparative geographic data showed that the areas of attack in the videos included Tel Nof and Nevatim airports. This raises questions about the capacity of the multilayered air defense net that protects Israel, as well as how the \"overloading\" tactic may have helped Iran overcome Tel Aviv\\'s and its allies\\' defenses in the October 1 attack. Tom Karako, an expert on missile defense at the U.S.-based Institute for International Studies of Strategy (CSIS), said that Iran\\'s missile screen was breached on October 1 far more than the attack with more than three hundred rockets and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in April. \"This seems to be an overwhelming attack, focused on a small number of targets in the limited area, rather than a wide range attack. We warned that this tactic could overwhelm Israel\\'s very strong multilayered air defense network,\" writes Tyler Rogoway, a U.S. military site for War Zone. Israel has an air defense network that can deal with a wide range of threats, from rockets and UAV suicide attacks to ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. The Israeli Iron Dome system is often noted for its high target intercept rate. However, it is a short-range air defense complex that is only for rockets and mortars, which are slow, low-flying, and predictable trajectories, and is incapable of intercepting ballistic missiles. The current Israeli ballistic missile shield consists of the Arrow 2/3 and David\\'s Sling long-range systems. Israel developed the Arrow missile line in the mid-1990s to meet Iran\\'s threat, a program that cost billions of dollars and is considered one of the world\\'s most advanced missile shields. The Arrow system is optimized for intercepting short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles, which are not suitable for shooting down conventional rockets and aircraft. The Arrow 2 missile uses a fragmented explosive tip, which destroys ballistic missiles in the stratosphere at an altitude of over 20 kilometers, preventing the chance that warhead debris will spread radioactive or biochemical material into Israeli territory. The Arrow 3 missile uses optical sensors to find targets, which do not carry explosives but utilize high mobility to intercept and destroy targets with kinetic energy. The Arrow 3 system can intercept ballistic missiles in space, before they return to the atmosphere and hit targets. Dov Raviv, who has been called the \"father of the Arrow shield,\" in 2004 claimed that each bullet had a 90 percent target destruction rate., link: https://vnexpress.net/chien-thuat-gay-qua-tai-cua-iran-voi-luoi-phong-khong-israel-4799479.html',\n 'The Arrow\\'s team, under which it misses, launches two more missiles in a short time, one of which can be redirected to the next target if the enemy missile is destroyed. \"This allows the Arrow\\'s system to reach a 99.9 percent intercept rate and meet the requirement of only one of 1,000 hits. Each team also has the ability to shoot down more than five ballistic missiles simultaneously within 30 seconds, a capability currently held by the U.S. and Russia,\" he said. Beneath the Arrow is the David\\'s Sling, manufactured in partnership with Israel\\'s Rafael and U.S. Raytheon, capable of shooting down missiles from up to 300 kilometers, developed to replace the Tel Aviv\\'s poorly designed Patriot systems. The David\\'s Sling is armed with twelve Stunner missiles that use a direct collision kill mechanism. The most distinctive feature of the Stunner is its multi-channel approach detector system, which contains a dolphin-like tip containing a thermal imaging sensor, an electro-optical probe, and an active electronically scanned array radar (AESA) probe. This design makes it difficult for the enemy to fool the Stunner missiles, and it increases the ability to kill hard targets such as ballistic missiles and stealth cruise missiles. During the October 1 attack, the IRGC claimed to have used the Fattah supersonic missile and \"destroyed the Arrow 2/3 combination radar.\" The supersonic missile is a weapon with a minimum speed of five times the speed of sound (Mach 5), or more than 6,200 kilometers per hour. Those that travel faster than sound but do not reach Mach 5 are usually referred to as supersonic missiles. The IRGC launched the Fattah supersonic missile in June 2023, describing it as Iran\\'s \"big leap in missile defense.\" Iranian officials said the Fattah had a range of 1,400 kilometers, a top speed of about 15,000 kilometers per hour, fourteen times faster than sound, and the ability to \"penetrate all defense shields.\" A fragment recovered from the attack, according to Fabian Hinz, an expert on Iran\\'s missile program at the U.K. - based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), was shaped like the wings of the Fattah - 1 and the Kheibar Shekan medium - range ballistic missile. \"These two missiles share the same dynamic system and are difficult to distinguish, but it is possible to say that Iran used the most advanced missiles in the attack,\" he said. Meanwhile, some experts say the Fattah is a conventional ballistic missile, not a supersonic missile because it lacks the ability to move continuously at high speeds through the enemy air defenses. According to Hinz, the Fattah missile carries a large, maneuverable reentry warhead that is similar to the supersonic glide vehicle, but less maneuverable and mostly stays in fixed trajectories in the mid-course. They can suddenly increase altitude as they hit targets and create a rise and fall, which increases range, modulates flight direction, and makes it difficult for the enemy missile shield to be protected. \"This is an improvement on the Fattah missile over older Iranian missiles,\" he added. The rapid launch of nearly 200 missiles in a matter of minutes indicates that Iran not only wants to overwhelm the Israeli air defenses, but also to drain the enemy\\'s expensive ammunition reserves. A former IDF commander\\'s financial adviser said the Arrow\\'s missiles cost $3.5 million each, the version of which is unknown, while the David\\'s Sling missiles cost $1 million each., link: https://vnexpress.net/chien-thuat-gay-qua-tai-cua-iran-voi-luoi-phong-khong-israel-4799479.html',\n '\"It means that Israel lost hundreds of millions, or even several billion dollars, to shoot down over 100 Iranian missiles on the night of October 1,\" the man said. Israel has not yet announced the specific damage caused by the Iranian strike, nor the number of missiles it intercepted. Tel Aviv said only that the attack \"did not cause major damage to infrastructure\" and left one civilian dead, two injured.
