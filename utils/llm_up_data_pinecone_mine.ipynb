Người đến sống ở Hà Nội ngày một nhiều, nhưng tinh thần \"người Hà Nội\" xưa đã biến đổi theo thời gian, là điều những người yêu Hà Nội trăn trở.\n","Khái niệm \"Người Hà Nội\" chưa xuất hiện ngay vào thời điểm vua Minh Mạng ra chỉ dụ thành lập tỉnh Hà Nội (1831). Tính cách người Hà Nội kế thừa nét thanh lịch của con người đất kinh kỳ. Thanh lịch là một từ cổ, gồm thanh và lịch. Thanh chỉ sự trong sáng, tự nhiên. Lịch chỉ sự hiểu biết và tuân thủ các quy định, phép tắc.\n","Nét đặc sắc của người Hà Nội còn do ảnh hưởng của văn hóa phương Tây, nhất là văn hóa Pháp. Qua biến động của thời cuộc, người Hà Nội không quên nỗi đau mất nước nhưng vẫn mở lòng học những cái hay, cái tiến bộ của một nền văn minh mới, làm giàu có thêm cho văn hóa của mình.\n","Những trái ngọt của tương tác văn minh Đông Tây hầu như diễn ra trên đất Hà Nội: âm nhạc có tân nhạc hay còn gọi là nhạc tiền chiến, văn chương có phong trào Thơ mới, tiểu thuyết Tự lực văn đoàn, hội họa có trường phái Mỹ thuật Đông Dương với các danh họa như Tô Ngọc Vân, Lê Phổ...\n","Trong đời sống hàng ngày, người Hà Nội cũng thay đổi, Âu hóa hơn. Nữ để tóc bồng, mặc áo dài Lơ mur Cát Tường. Nam biết chơi thể thao, mặc veston, đi giày hay sandal. Nam nữ thanh niên có đời sống tâm hồn lãng mạn, thích đọc thơ, đọc tiểu thuyết tình cảm, biết cắm hoa, thích nghe nhạc, đi tắm biển.\n","Những năm 1930, khái niệm \"Người Hà Nội\" mới hình thành. Giới trí thức lúc đó so sánh Hà Nội đẹp và thơ mộng như một Paris thu nhỏ. Pháp có Parisiens (người Paris) thì Hà Nội cũng có Hanoïens (người Hà Nội, tiếng Pháp). Người Hà Nội thanh lịch giờ thêm nét lãng mạn hiện đại, như là một sản phẩm giao hòa của văn hóa Đông Tây.\n","Đêm 19/12/1946, nhạc sĩ trẻ Nguyễn Đình Thi được lệnh rời Hà Nội. Ra đến ngoại ô thì đèn đường phụt tắt, súng nổ, toàn quốc kháng chiến bắt đầu. Nhiều chiến sĩ tự vệ Hà Nội hy sinh ngay trên hè phố, cách cửa nhà mình chỉ vài bước chân. Dừng chân ở căn cứ ngoại thành, nhìn về Hà Nội cháy đỏ trời, bên chiếc đàn piano mà người dân Hà Nội tản cư bỏ lại, Nguyễn Đình Thi đã cảm xúc gõ những nốt đầu tiên \"Bài hát của một người Hà Nội\": \"Bùng cháy khắp phố ta ơi! Vùng lên, chiến sĩ ta ơi! Trời Hà Nội đỏ máu!\". Bài hát được hoàn chỉnh năm 1948 và mang tên \"Người Hà Nội\".\n","Ba chữ \"Người Hà Nội\" đi vào nghệ thuật. Thử thách đã làm bộc lộ chất hào sảng của người Hà Nội, sẵn sàng đứng lên khi Tổ quốc cần. Những năm kháng chiến chống Pháp, rồi chống Mỹ, tuy gian khổ nhưng khí chất ấy của người Hà Nội vẫn không thay đổi.\n","Nhưng chiến tranh, cùng một số sai lầm trong chính sách quản lý xã hội, làm cho đô thị Hà Nội có nhiều biến đổi, và chất thanh lịch của con người cũng dần phôi pha. Chính sách xóa bỏ tư sản tư thương cũng xoá sổ luôn tầng lớp trung lưu của Hà Nội. Tầng lớp trung lưu là những người lưu giữ nhiều nhất các di sản văn hóa của một xã hội.\n","Cơ cấu nhân khẩu học thay đổi, nhiều thành phần dân cư mới về Hà Nội, mang theo nhiều nếp sống vùng miền khác nhau. Mỗi số nhà ngày trước là của một gia đình nay chia cho hàng chục gia đình. Ở thì chật chội ra đụng vào chạm, còn đâu là thanh tao, lịch lãm.\n","Thời Đổi Mới, xóa bỏ bao cấp, kinh tế phát triển. Đô thị Hà Nội phát triển, cư dân tăng cơ học nhanh, hàng triệu người từ mọi miền nhập cư vào Hà Nội. Bùng nổ xây dựng, các di sản kiến trúc bắt đầu mất mát và ngày càng nguy cấp.\n","===============\n","Hanoi people Doctors, Doctors of Medicine But I see more and more that the three words \"Hanoi\" fade. People come to live in Hanoi more and more, but the spirit of \"Hanoi\" has changed over time, which is what Hanoi lovers are troubled by. The concept of \"Hanoi\" did not appear at the time when King Minh Mạng decreed the founding of Hanoi province (1831). The character of the Hanoi people inherits the elegance of the extraordinary land people. Elegance is an old word, composed of elegance and elegance. Elegance refers to innocence, nature. Elegance refers to understanding and observance of regulations and rules. The characteristics of the Hanoi people are also influenced by Western culture, especially French culture. Through the upheavals of times, the Hanoi people do not forget the pain of losing their country but open their hearts to learn the charms and advances of a new civilization that enrich their culture. The fruits of East and West cultural interaction almost take place on Hanoi land: music with new music, also called prewar music, literature with a new poetry movement, self-help fiction, painting with Indochina school of Fine Arts with artists such as To Ngoc Van, Le Pho... In everyday life, the Hanoi people also change and become more Europeanized. Women wear flowing hair, a frock coat, a flannel shirt. Men can play sports, wear suits, shoes or sandals. Young men and women have a romantic life, love to read poetry, love novels, flower arrangement, love music, go to the beach. In the 1930s, the concept of \"Hanoi\" was newly formed. Intellectuals at the time compared Hanoi beautiful and poetic as a miniature Paris. France had Parisiens, Hanoi had Hanoens. The elegant Hanoi people now have a modern romance, as a product of harmony of East and West culture. On the night of December 19,1946, the young musician Nguyen Dinh Thi was ordered to leave Hanoi. On the outskirts the street lights went out, guns blazed, the resistance began in the whole country. Many Hanoi self-defense soldiers died on the pavement just a few steps from their door. Stopping at the outlying base, looking at the burning Hanoi, by the piano left behind by the Hanoi evacuees, Nguyen Dinh Thi felt the first notes of \"The Song of a Hanoi man\": \"Burn up the street, my soldier, blood is red in Hanoi.\" The song was completed in 1948 and bore the name \"Hanoi.\" The three words \"Hanoi\" entered the arts. The trials have revealed the greatness of the Hanoi people, ready to rise when the Fatherland needs it. The years of resistance against France and then against the United States, though arduous, have not changed the temperament of the Hanoi people. But the war, and some mistakes in social management, have caused much change in the Hanoi city, and the elegance of the people has gradually evaporated. The policy of abolishing private bourgeoisie has also obliterated the middle class of Hanoi. The middle class is the most relics of a society. The demographic structure has changed, many new inhabitants have moved to Hanoi, bringing with them different regional ways of life. Each house that was once owned by one family is now divided among dozens. It is cramped and touchless, but elegant and elegant. During the doi moi, the abolition of subsidies, the economy has developed. The Hanoi city has grown, the population has increased mechanically rapidly, millions of people from all regions have immigrated to Hanoi. The explosion of construction, the architectural heritages have begun to lose and become increasingly endangered.\n","===============\n","https://vnexpress.net/nguoi-ha-noi-4800840.html\n","\n","===============\n","https://vnexpress.net/nguoi-ha-noi-4800840.html\n","\n","===============\n"]}],"source":["with

that cause many people to wake up in the middle of the night without being able to fall asleep again. Have you ever stared at the empty space at 3: 00 or 4: 00 a. m.? Is that just bad habit or is something more serious going on and why does it always happen at this time? \"We start getting shallow sleep around 4 to 5: 00 p. m.,\" says Lisa Artis, deputy executive director of the charity The Sleep Charity. When people are at this stage, it's easy to wake up. If you normally go to bed around 11: 00 p. m., getting up at 4: 00 a. m. is likely. There are many factors that lead to these unwanted awakenings. \"Sleep is regulated by the body's circadian clock, or circadian rhythm. One of the most important circadian rhythms is the sleep-wake cycle,\" says Artis. Sleep is regulated by two hormones, melatonin and cortisol, on a regular 24-hour cycle. Melatonin helps ease falling asleep, while cortisol helps wake up and stay awake. Monitoring hormones is important to prevent late-night awakenings. Dr. Mariyam H. Malik, of Pall Mall Medical, recommends engaging in relaxing activities before bed, such as reading, listening to soothing music, or practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation. At the same time, put down your phone, because blue light from electronic devices can inhibit melatonin production. Try to avoid screens at least two hours before bed, or use a blue light filter. It's best to charge them in another room overnight. Diet caffeine, high-energy meals, alcohol, sugar, and lack of magnesium or B vitamins can further disrupt sleep, Malik says. In particular, sugar and carbohydrates can cause blood sugar fluctuations, leading to wakefulness during the night. \"A diet high in refined sugars and sugars can cause blood sugar fluctuations, leading to nighttime wakefulness,\" she says. Artis notes that the body will not feel hungry in the middle of the night if blood sugar drops. However, to reduce waking at an undesirable time, try changing the last meal or snack of the day. Instead of opting for carbohydrate-based snacks or sweets, opt for foods high in protein and magnesium like hard-boiled eggs, cottage cheese, pumpkin seeds, spinach, black chocolate, cashews, chicken thighs, or turkey. Protein can reduce nighttime hunger, while magnesium is known to aid sleep. Nocturnal bathroom Malik recommends trying not to drink too much liquid before bed. The key is to maintain adequate hydration, but try not to drink anything for about two hours before your regular bedtime. It's recommended to use the bathroom before bed to clear your bladder. Age and life stages \"Sleep tends to be more disrupted as people age,\" explains Malik. The pattern of sleep changes with age, and many factors can contribute to sleep disturbances in older people. Some common reasons include changes in circadian rhythm, decreased melatonin production, medical conditions or medications, and underlying sleep disorders. This can also affect women in the perimenopause. The reproductive hormones - estrogen and progesterone - have a close connection to the sleep and relaxation hormones, melatonin and serotonin. When estrogen levels start dropping before and during menopause, this causes a disturbance in the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin, which prevents estrogen levels from properly balancing with cortisol. \"When this happens, the ability to fall asleep and maintain sleep is affected,\" says Artis. Symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, dry skin, and decreased libido can be signs of declining estrogen.\n","\n","URL Chunk: https://vnexpress.net/chenh-venh-tuoi-30-4795186.html\n","\n","Content: Artis recommends adding phytoestrogen-rich foods to your diet every day to help keep your body balanced. Phytoestrogens mimic naturally occurring estrogens in your body. Therefore, they can bind to your body's estrogen receptors and produce similar effects. Try foods like lentils, red beans, chickpeas, tofu, edamame, spinach, cauliflower, and broccoli. Stress is bad for your sleep. A study by Bupa (health insurance provider) found that 32 million UK people woke up worrying about their health at exactly 4: 05 PM. This report, which surveyed 4,000 UK adults, revealed that more than three-fifths of them woke up in the middle of the night. If you frequently wake up worrying or having stressful dreams, keep a journal by your bedside and write down your worries before going to bed. This practice can help get your worries out of your mind and make it easier to let go temporarily. In addition, you can engage in mindfulness exercises or meditation before bed. Mindfulness meditation can help focus on the present, reduce worries about the past or the future. \n","\n","URL Chunk: https://vnexpress.net/chenh-venh-tuoi-30-4795186.html\n","\n","Content: 7 Vegetables that reduce belly fat quickly Spinach, squash, cauliflower, carrots, bitter gourd, and cucumbers are vegetables that reduce belly fat quickly. Vegetables can help you lose weight because they are rich in fiber, nutrients, and water, so they are filling while consuming few calories. Fiber in vegetables aids digestion and promotes satiety, reducing the likelihood of overeating. Many vegetables have low glycemic indexes, which can stabilize blood sugar and control appetite. Spinach Spinach is a nutrient-rich vegetable, suitable for any diet aimed at reducing belly fat. It is low in calories and high in fiber, which helps people feel full for longer. According to a study published in Appetite, thylakoids found in spinach can reduce hunger and appetite by 95 percent. Spinach's high magnesium levels help regulate blood sugar and control weight. Add spinach to your diet by adding it to salads, smoothies, or cooked dishes. Squash Squash is low in calories and high in water content, making it perfect for weight loss. A study in the International Journal of Food and Nutrition Sciences found that the high water and fiber content of squash promotes satiety by reducing calories and reducing body fat. Cauliflower Cauliflower contains compounds such as indoles, which have been shown to regulate hormones and reduce belly fat. Research shows that eating more cruciferous vegetables such as cauliflower can reduce visceral fat. Carrots Carrots are good for eyesight and waistline because they are low in calories, high in fiber and vitamins and antioxidants. A study in Nutrition found that eating carrots can increase satiety and reduce body fat. Raw carrots are a crunchy snack, or cooked with soup, served with salads. Gurmar Gurmar Gurmar may not be everyone's favorite food due to its bitter taste, but the weight-loss benefits are undeniable. Gurmar contains compounds that help regulate insulin, control blood sugar, and reduce belly fat. A study published in BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine found that bitter melon extract significantly reduces belly fat in mice. It can be prepared by traditional cooking or juice. Cucumbers are refreshing, hydrating, and detoxifying. With a high water content, cucumber also helps weight loss because of its low calories. According to a study in the Journal of Nutrition and Diet, a diet rich in water-rich foods such as cucumbers can help control weight. You can enjoy cucumber as a salad, or simply as a snack.\n","\n","URL Chunk: https://vnexpress.net/an-toi-voi-nguoi-la-4798038.html\n","\n","Content: What's good for your heart?

My 9-year-old child has sore throat, loss of appetite, fever, flashlight examination of throat and tonsils red and swollen. Is this symptom of strep throat, how to treat? ( Ngoc Anh, 29 years old, Lam Dong) Answer: The symptoms of strep throat include sudden high fever, tonsillar edema and white pseudomembranes, red throat. Some cases the patient has enlarged lymph nodes, painful pressure in the anterior neck area. According to your description, the doctor cannot confirm whether the child has strep throat or not. Because acute pharyngitis caused by many causes, the symptoms are not specific and resemble with pharyngitis caused by influenza virus, para-influenzae virus, coxsakie virus... You should take your child to the hospital for the doctor to examine and test to determine the cause of the disease. For the correct diagnosis, the doctor may appoint the patient to quickly check the throat fluid for group A streptococcus. This is an easy, non-invasive test, quick result, and reasonable cost. The throat swab is painless. The medical staff uses a long specialized Q-tip to remove the fluid behind the throat, then give the sample for quick test. The result is about 30 minutes later, if positive, it means the parapharyngeal area of your child has the presence of pathogenic streptococcus. The main method of treatment strep throat is antibiotics. Depending on the patient's condition, atopic, the doctor may prescribe different antibiotics, prioritizing the most appropriate type. The patient may have to take oral or parenteral antibiotics for 10 days. Note to take the medication as prescribed by the doctor and use all medication even when the symptoms have improved. The improper dosage of medication increases the risk of recurrence and resistance. In addition to antibiotics, the doctor may prescribe other drugs to treat symptoms such as antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, etc.\n","\n"]}],"source":["# import pickle\n","\n","# with open('/kaggle/input/vn-news/total_url_chunks.pkl', 'rb') as file:\n","#     total_url_chunks = pickle.load(file)\n","\n","# with open('/kaggle/input/vn-news-output/total_output_clean.pkl', 'rb') as file:\n","#     total_output_clean = pickle.load(file)\n","\n","# mapped_data = list(zip(total_url_chunks, total_output_clean))\n","\n","# for url_chunk, output_clean in mapped_data[:5]:\n","#     print(f\"URL Chunk: {url_chunk}\")\n","#     print(f\"Content: {output_clean}\\n\")\n","    \n","# mapped_data = {key: (total_url_chunks[key], total_output_clean[key]) for key in total_url_chunks if key in total_output_clean}\n","\n","# for key, (url_chunk, output_clean) in list(mapped_data.items())[:5]:\n","#     print(f\"Key: {key}\")\n","#     print(f\"URL Chunk: {url_chunk}\")\n","#     print(f\"Content: {output_clean}\\n\")\n"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":5794463,"sourceId":9517658,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"},{"datasetId":5805993,"sourceId":9533144,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"},{"datasetId":5814560,"sourceId":9544370,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30775,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"LLM","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.14"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
