that cause many people to wake up in the middle of the night without being able to fall asleep again. Have you ever stared at the empty space at 3: 00 or 4: 00 a. m.? Is that just bad habit or is something more serious going on and why does it always happen at this time? \"We start getting shallow sleep around 4 to 5: 00 p. m.,\" says Lisa Artis, deputy executive director of the charity The Sleep Charity. When people are at this stage, it's easy to wake up. If you normally go to bed around 11: 00 p. m., getting up at 4: 00 a. m. is likely. There are many factors that lead to these unwanted awakenings. \"Sleep is regulated by the body's circadian clock, or circadian rhythm. One of the most important circadian rhythms is the sleep-wake cycle,\" says Artis. Sleep is regulated by two hormones, melatonin and cortisol, on a regular 24-hour cycle. Melatonin helps ease falling asleep, while cortisol helps wake up and stay awake. Monitoring hormones is important to prevent late-night awakenings. Dr. Mariyam H. Malik, of Pall Mall Medical, recommends engaging in relaxing activities before bed, such as reading, listening to soothing music, or practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation. At the same time, put down your phone, because blue light from electronic devices can inhibit melatonin production. Try to avoid screens at least two hours before bed, or use a blue light filter. It's best to charge them in another room overnight. Diet caffeine, high-energy meals, alcohol, sugar, and lack of magnesium or B vitamins can further disrupt sleep, Malik says. In particular, sugar and carbohydrates can cause blood sugar fluctuations, leading to wakefulness during the night. \"A diet high in refined sugars and sugars can cause blood sugar fluctuations, leading to nighttime wakefulness,\" she says. Artis notes that the body will not feel hungry in the middle of the night if blood sugar drops. However, to reduce waking at an undesirable time, try changing the last meal or snack of the day. Instead of opting for carbohydrate-based snacks or sweets, opt for foods high in protein and magnesium like hard-boiled eggs, cottage cheese, pumpkin seeds, spinach, black chocolate, cashews, chicken thighs, or turkey. Protein can reduce nighttime hunger, while magnesium is known to aid sleep. Nocturnal bathroom Malik recommends trying not to drink too much liquid before bed. The key is to maintain adequate hydration, but try not to drink anything for about two hours before your regular bedtime. It's recommended to use the bathroom before bed to clear your bladder. Age and life stages \"Sleep tends to be more disrupted as people age,\" explains Malik. The pattern of sleep changes with age, and many factors can contribute to sleep disturbances in older people. Some common reasons include changes in circadian rhythm, decreased melatonin production, medical conditions or medications, and underlying sleep disorders. This can also affect women in the perimenopause. The reproductive hormones - estrogen and progesterone - have a close connection to the sleep and relaxation hormones, melatonin and serotonin. When estrogen levels start dropping before and during menopause, this causes a disturbance in the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin, which prevents estrogen levels from properly balancing with cortisol. \"When this happens, the ability to fall asleep and maintain sleep is affected,\" says Artis. Symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, dry skin, and decreased libido can be signs of declining estrogen.\n","\n","URL Chunk: https://vnexpress.net/chenh-venh-tuoi-30-4795186.html\n","\n","Content: Artis recommends adding phytoestrogen-rich foods to your diet every day to help keep your body balanced. Phytoestrogens mimic naturally occurring estrogens in your body. Therefore, they can bind to your body's estrogen receptors and produce similar effects. Try foods like lentils, red beans, chickpeas, tofu, edamame, spinach, cauliflower, and broccoli. Stress is bad for your sleep. A study by Bupa (health insurance provider) found that 32 million UK people woke up worrying about their health at exactly 4: 05 PM. This report, which surveyed 4,000 UK adults, revealed that more than three-fifths of them woke up in the middle of the night. If you frequently wake up worrying or having stressful dreams, keep a journal by your bedside and write down your worries before going to bed. This practice can help get your worries out of your mind and make it easier to let go temporarily. In addition, you can engage in mindfulness exercises or meditation before bed. Mindfulness meditation can help focus on the present, reduce worries about the past or the future. \n","\n","URL Chunk: https://vnexpress.net/chenh-venh-tuoi-30-4795186.html\n","\n","Content: 7 Vegetables that reduce belly fat quickly Spinach, squash, cauliflower, carrots, bitter gourd, and cucumbers are vegetables that reduce belly fat quickly. Vegetables can help you lose weight because they are rich in fiber, nutrients, and water, so they are filling while consuming few calories. Fiber in vegetables aids digestion and promotes satiety, reducing the likelihood of overeating. Many vegetables have low glycemic indexes, which can stabilize blood sugar and control appetite. Spinach Spinach is a nutrient-rich vegetable, suitable for any diet aimed at reducing belly fat. It is low in calories and high in fiber, which helps people feel full for longer. According to a study published in Appetite, thylakoids found in spinach can reduce hunger and appetite by 95 percent. Spinach's high magnesium levels help regulate blood sugar and control weight. Add spinach to your diet by adding it to salads, smoothies, or cooked dishes. Squash Squash is low in calories and high in water content, making it perfect for weight loss. A study in the International Journal of Food and Nutrition Sciences found that the high water and fiber content of squash promotes satiety by reducing calories and reducing body fat. Cauliflower Cauliflower contains compounds such as indoles, which have been shown to regulate hormones and reduce belly fat. Research shows that eating more cruciferous vegetables such as cauliflower can reduce visceral fat. Carrots Carrots are good for eyesight and waistline because they are low in calories, high in fiber and vitamins and antioxidants. A study in Nutrition found that eating carrots can increase satiety and reduce body fat. Raw carrots are a crunchy snack, or cooked with soup, served with salads. Gurmar Gurmar Gurmar may not be everyone's favorite food due to its bitter taste, but the weight-loss benefits are undeniable. Gurmar contains compounds that help regulate insulin, control blood sugar, and reduce belly fat. A study published in BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine found that bitter melon extract significantly reduces belly fat in mice. It can be prepared by traditional cooking or juice. Cucumbers are refreshing, hydrating, and detoxifying. With a high water content, cucumber also helps weight loss because of its low calories. According to a study in the Journal of Nutrition and Diet, a diet rich in water-rich foods such as cucumbers can help control weight. You can enjoy cucumber as a salad, or simply as a snack.\n","\n","URL Chunk: https://vnexpress.net/an-toi-voi-nguoi-la-4798038.html\n","\n","Content: What's good for your heart?

My 9-year-old child has sore throat, loss of appetite, fever, flashlight examination of throat and tonsils red and swollen. Is this symptom of strep throat, how to treat? ( Ngoc Anh, 29 years old, Lam Dong) Answer: The symptoms of strep throat include sudden high fever, tonsillar edema and white pseudomembranes, red throat. Some cases the patient has enlarged lymph nodes, painful pressure in the anterior neck area. According to your description, the doctor cannot confirm whether the child has strep throat or not. Because acute pharyngitis caused by many causes, the symptoms are not specific and resemble with pharyngitis caused by influenza virus, para-influenzae virus, coxsakie virus... You should take your child to the hospital for the doctor to examine and test to determine the cause of the disease. For the correct diagnosis, the doctor may appoint the patient to quickly check the throat fluid for group A streptococcus. This is an easy, non-invasive test, quick result, and reasonable cost. The throat swab is painless. The medical staff uses a long specialized Q-tip to remove the fluid behind the throat, then give the sample for quick test. The result is about 30 minutes later, if positive, it means the parapharyngeal area of your child has the presence of pathogenic streptococcus. The main method of treatment strep throat is antibiotics. Depending on the patient's condition, atopic, the doctor may prescribe different antibiotics, prioritizing the most appropriate type. The patient may have to take oral or parenteral antibiotics for 10 days. Note to take the medication as prescribed by the doctor and use all medication even when the symptoms have improved. The improper dosage of medication increases the risk of recurrence and resistance. In addition to antibiotics, the doctor may prescribe other drugs to treat symptoms such as antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, etc.\n","\n"]}],"source":["# import pickle\n","\n","# with open('/kaggle/input/vn-news/total_url_chunks.pkl', 'rb') as file:\n","#     total_url_chunks = pickle.load(file)\n","\n","# with open('/kaggle/input/vn-news-output/total_output_clean.pkl', 'rb') as file:\n","#     total_output_clean = pickle.load(file)\n","\n","# mapped_data = list(zip(total_url_chunks, total_output_clean))\n","\n","# for url_chunk, output_clean in mapped_data[:5]:\n","#     print(f\"URL Chunk: {url_chunk}\")\n","#     print(f\"Content: {output_clean}\\n\")\n","    \n","# mapped_data = {key: (total_url_chunks[key], total_output_clean[key]) for key in total_url_chunks if key in total_output_clean}\n","\n","# for key, (url_chunk, output_clean) in list(mapped_data.items())[:5]:\n","#     print(f\"Key: {key}\")\n","#     print(f\"URL Chunk: {url_chunk}\")\n","#     print(f\"Content: {output_clean}\\n\")\n"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":5794463,"sourceId":9517658,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"},{"datasetId":5805993,"sourceId":9533144,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"},{"datasetId":5814560,"sourceId":9544370,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30775,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"LLM","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.14"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
